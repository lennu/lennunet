I assume that you are in branch and youâ€™d like to forget about your commits.

If you want to reset the whole branch and make it look like its master, and lose all the changes use this command:

```
git reset --hard master
```

If you want to reset the previous commit but not lose the changes use this:

```
git reset HEAD^
```

If you want to continue working but have the changes included in the same commit then you can use this:

```
git commit --amend
```

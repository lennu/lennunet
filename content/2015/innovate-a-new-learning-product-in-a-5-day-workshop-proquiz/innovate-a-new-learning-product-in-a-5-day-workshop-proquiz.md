ProQuiz – Mobile contest about math and programming!
----------------------------------------------------

{% image "./proquiz.png", "ProQuiz" %}

Users installs the software to their mobile phones which will get hard questions about math or programming to the users to solve. The user is notified when a question arrives and he or she can submit a solution to that question in a specific time frame.

Users get more points the faster they submit the answer. This will produce a ranking around the users, which the competition is about.

### Prototype

We made a working prototype of the project by using Android on the client side and Mosquitto on the server side.

Big thanks goes to [Anton Lopyrev](http://tokudu.com/2010/how-to-implement-push-notifications-for-android/) for creating this great post about the subject.

You can test our application by downloading the app from the Google Play.

[ProQuiz on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bilkenthaaga.proquiz)

Just install it to your phone and fire it up!

Then just activate the push service and wait for questions to arrive!

When a question arrives there is a notification and it will take you to the application where you can submit an answer.

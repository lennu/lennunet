My friend made a script that crawls websites and for testing he chose our university: [Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences](http://www.haaga-helia.fi). Believe it or not, he actually got over 37000 files in publicly available folders from our universitys’ file server myy.haaga-helia.fi. The records are available at [tradenomi.noob.fi](http://tradenomi.noob.fi).  

So what kind of files was found?
--------------------------------

Well most of the files are documents, powerpoints and excels containing student work. Nothing really important I guess (I haven’t browsed all of the 37000 files).

How ever what I found the most interesting were the CVs or curriculum vitaes also known as list of achievements of a person. With search `CV` you can find three pages of different CVs.

### Code files

There are very much files of code. If you search for `java` you will get 4000 files with java code, so it is kind of database of code examples. Of course alot of the files are in finnish.

Security
--------

Since there are CVs and alot of documents containing personal information, this raises question: is this a security issue? And whos’ is it?

University offers a place for saving documents in public Internet, known as public\_html within students personal data folder. When you save a file in there, the file will be in the Internet. I guess university should make some clarifications for some students that their files truly are publicly available when they save a file in their public folder.

### Experiment

After being online for quite some time, my friend released some statistics [tradenomi.noob.fi/tophaut.php](http://tradenomi.noob.fi/tophaut.php). These are the top 20 searches done lately. I’ll translate some of them here: cv, programming, mathematics, pictures, businessprocesses and of course porn and sex.

So there have been some proper searches and I guess some good results too.

The site is elegantly build and serves its’ purpose nicely. It caused a lot of discussion in our university and as far as I know it has already been reported to the ICT-security team of the university. The best thing about this site is of course the fact that you can go and search for a file that contains your next deadline homework.

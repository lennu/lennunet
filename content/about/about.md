## About Lennu.net

Most of the people know me these days by the name of Lennu. So I started this personal website on 2006 just to play around with websites. On 2009 I changed the website to host HAAGA-HELIA Student Party Gallery, and it went quite popular in the university. I kept it for two years up and running, and on 2012 I decided to start a technology blog here.

			"content_html": "<p>TOR is a network within the internet created for extreme security which has a lot of features for anonymization. So, it’s a way to browse the internet anonymized, unrecognized and hidden from the authorities. In this post I’m going to access TOR and its onion addresses with Linux Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>So, first install VirtualBox, which makes it possible to start another operating system within your current operating system without actually installing it on your computer. There are plenty of tutorials that you can find on the internet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"download-tails\" tabindex=\"-1\">Download Tails <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/step-by-step-access-to-tor-network-with-tails-using-virtualbox/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Accessing TOR is easy by starting up Tails. Its an operating system with features that helps the access to TOR network. First go to <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/install/vm-download/index.en.html\">https://tails.boum.org/install/vm-download/index.en.html</a> and download the ISO-image.</p>\n<p><strong>Note that you should always verify the download!</strong> I used the detailed instructions found from that same link under the subtitle of “See instructions for basic OpenPGP verification”. I used command line to do this.</p>\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key\">Tails signing key</a> and import it to your GnuPGP with <code>gpg --import tails-signing.key</code>. You should see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>gpg: key xxxx: public key &quot;Tails developers tails@boum.org&quot; imported\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)\ngpg: no ultimately trusted keys found\n</code></pre>\n<p>Download OpenPGP signature for your Tails version. This should be found from the original download page. Then execute the following command with modified filenames.</p>\n<pre><code>TZ=UTC gpg --no-options --keyid-format long --verify tails-amd64-4.6.iso.sig tails-amd64-4.6.iso\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see this to verify the authenticity of the image. Also check the date is within five days of the latest version, with this version it should be within five days from 2020-05-05.</p>\n<pre><code>gpg: Signature made ma 4. toukokuuta 2020 20.45.29 UTC\ngpg: using RSA key xxx\ngpg: Good signature from &quot;Tails developers tails@boum.org&quot;\ngpg: aka &quot;Tails developers (offline long-term identity key) tails@boum.org&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following warning can be ignored.</p>\n<pre><code>gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\ngpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Great, now we have downloaded and verified the image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"starting-tails-with-virtualbox\" tabindex=\"-1\">Starting Tails with VirtualBox <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/step-by-step-access-to-tor-network-with-tails-using-virtualbox/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Start VirtualBox and click New. Select Linux and Other Linux (64 bit). Give the VirtualBox 2048 MB of RAM and do not add an hard drive.</p>\n<p>Open Settings of the machine just created. Confirm that Enable I/O APIC is enabled in System/Motherboard. Go to Storage, choose Empty and click on the little CD icon dropdown on the right. From the dropdown select “Choose Virtual Optical Disk Drive”. Browse to the downloaded Tails image and select it. Make sure to toggle Live CD/DVD on. Click OK and click big green Start button. Configure your locale settings when prompted and start using Tails.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/m5097RtQmB-1024.avif 1024w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/m5097RtQmB-1024.webp 1024w\"><img alt=\"Tails operating system\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/m5097RtQmB-1024.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"743\"></picture></p>\n<h2 id=\"using-tails-and-accessing-tor-s-onion-addresses\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using Tails and accessing TOR’s onion addresses <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/step-by-step-access-to-tor-network-with-tails-using-virtualbox/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You should find TOR web browser from the Applications menu.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/qazjXGuKWO-1024.avif 1024w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/qazjXGuKWO-1024.webp 1024w\"><img alt=\"Tor web browser\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/qazjXGuKWO-1024.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\"></picture></p>\n<p>You can use for example https://duckduckgo.com and search for “tor search engine” to find TOR search engines where you can find the onion addresses.

It seems that most of the websites don’t work and similar images and texts are used around the websites which indicates that there could be same authors on multiple websites. There is even a forum for stock company insiders where you can sell your information. Mostly the websites are about criminal activity. I don’t want to promote their business on this blog but it can be seen from the image that there are a lot of search results in this area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-get-caught-even-when-using-tor\" tabindex=\"-1\">You can get caught even when using TOR <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/step-by-step-access-to-tor-network-with-tails-using-virtualbox/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/24/feds-operator-of-bay-area-dark-web-business-busted-for-alleged-drug-trafficking/\">https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/24/feds-operator-of-bay-area-dark-web-business-busted-for-alleged-drug-trafficking/</a> shows a case where police ordered drugs from the dark web, tracked the post office where it had been sent and inspected the surveillance cameras to bust the drug dealer.</p>\n<p>This is probably the simplest way to catch the drug dealer and yet there are still dealers that take the risk.</p>\n<p>There are some alternatives to TOR which are not so known by the public. For example, i2p and freenet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-tor-works\" tabindex=\"-1\">How TOR works <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/step-by-step-access-to-tor-network-with-tails-using-virtualbox/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>TOR is created from the principle of entry, exit and the nodes between these. The idea is that as there are many nodes between the client and the server responding to the answer it is hard to track who discusses with who.</p>\n<p>There is a directory available for TOR clients that has the list of nodes available. This directory can be fetched in encrypted connection (public key).</p>\n<p>When connecting to a specific address the client chooses random path made from three relay nodes listed in the directory. The message is encrypted three times then at each relay the message is decrypt once making the message plain when the exit node sends it to the wished location. Response is sent through the relay nodes where they encrypt it once on each step, then relay nodes share the encryption and decryption keys with the client which decrypts the message three times to view the message. Note that exit node transfers information in plain text.</p>\n<p>TOR relays use RSA algorithm with key sizes of 1024-bit to secure connections.</p>\n<p>TOR communications is one of the safest to hide one’s identity however there is a threat model for TOR. If adversary could obtain large amount of relay nodes under its observation there could be a vulnerability. This would be an immense task because there currently (5/2020) about 7000 relay nodes and 1000 exit nodes.</p>\n<p><em>This was the fifth assignment of <a href=\"http://terokarvinen.com/2020/ict-security-basics-from-trust-to-blockchain-itc4hm003-3001-2020-spring/\">ICT Security Basics</a>.</em></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>In ICT-security related matters CIA Triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. These are the core principles that categorize most of the security issues threatening information technologies.</p>\n<p>Confidentiality has are all things related to protecting unauthorized access to information. For example usernames and passwords are created for only authorized users if adversary can get access to a username and password combination the confidentiality has an issue.</p>\n<p>Integrity holds things that protect information from malformation and simply put from bad information. For example adversary might have some way to insert false data into a database, to change their bank account to have million dollars. There are systems specifically build to ensure the integrity of data which compare data between for example two places and triggers an alarm if there’s an issue.</p>\n<p>Availability is the simplest of the triad to grasp on. Availability means that information should be available when it is needed. Adversary might create a denial of service attack that would harm availability of a system. It is hard for an organization to resist this but for example having distributed systems might have an positive effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unbreakable-cipher\" tabindex=\"-1\">Unbreakable cipher <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/cia-triad-and-encryption-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There aren’t many unbreakable ciphers but <strong>One time pad</strong> is one of them.</p>\n<p>Pre-shared key, which should have same length or be longer than the message, is shared between sender and receiver. Each character in the message gets a modulo-addition from the shared key. For example with key BC and message AB the cipher is BD. Character A moves one letter to B, and character B moves two letters to D. Now when the secret key is only known by these two an adversary has no way of decoding the cipher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"symmetric-encryption-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Symmetric encryption example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/cia-triad-and-encryption-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Symmetric encryption is the straightforward give a key and the door will open. You can for example encrypt a zip file with WinRAR where it is using AES 256 encryption. In the user interface give a password and WinRAR will do the encryption.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/7g-wkgxVAP-480.avif 480w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/7g-wkgxVAP-480.webp 480w\"><img alt=\"Archive\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/7g-wkgxVAP-480.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"478\"></picture></p>\n<h2 id=\"asymmetric-encryption-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Asymmetric encryption example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/cia-triad-and-encryption-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Asymmetric encryption is something where both parties have a public and a secret key. The public key is used for encrypting the message and the secret key is used for opening that message.</p>\n<p>I made a little example with NodeJS and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa</a>. It uses by default public key cryptography scheme pkcs1-sha256.</p>\n<pre><code>const NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');\n\n// {b: 512} means 512 bit length key\nconst key = new NodeRSA({b: 512})\nconsole.log('key size:', key.getKeySize())\n\nconst message = 'Hello world!'\nconsole.log('message:', message)\n\nconst encrypted = key.encrypt(message, 'base64')\nconsole.log('encrypted: ', encrypted)\n\nconst decrypted = key.decrypt(encrypted, 'utf8')\nconsole.log('decrypted: ', decrypted)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output of this script it this:</p>\n<pre><code>key size: 512\nmessage: Hello world!\nencrypted: Di0USm6XxwV+OgpBteuJIBjDPVaLjhviJNRcDKYHQXGEPSeSde+kMHKAkDkcZNk+7AcL5OuQ0+CcBRyz3EUl8A==\ndecrypted: Hello world!\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"secure-ciphers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Secure ciphers <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/cia-triad-and-encryption-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are cracked ciphers and then there are the secure ones. The history of cryptography tells that most of the ciphers are eventually broken so organizations should be monitoring the cryptography news to know when to change their ciphers.</p>\n<p>For example AES and Twofish are considered secure encryption algorithms. MD5 and DES are examples of insecure encryption standards. One should always check for the security of the chosen algorithm before taking it into use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"diffie-and-hellman-s-1976-paper-new-directions-in-cryptography\" tabindex=\"-1\">Diffie and Hellman’s 1976 paper New Directions in Cryptography <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/cia-triad-and-encryption-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In their paper in 1976 the idea Diffie and Hellman introduced was the key exchange problem and how to solve it. It is called Diffie–Hellman key exchange. Before this the secure keys were transferred via physical means using paper or a trustee. The paper introduces a method where the keys can be transferred without the two parties having no prior knowledge of one another.</p>\n<h2 id=\"suspicious-encryption-products\" tabindex=\"-1\">Suspicious encryption products <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/cia-triad-and-encryption-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There should be suspicion when choosing any encryption tools. The company behind it should be reputable and the product should have users. This kind of software could control vital information and if the product is somehow compromised the information could be lost or it could used for blackmailing. For example I made a couple of years ago a software that encrypts messages using applied Data Encryption Standard <a href=\"https://www.lennu.net/data-encryption-standard-made-with-key-sizes-of-14-bits/\">https://www.lennu.net/data-encryption-standard-made-with-key-sizes-of-14-bits/</a>. I published the code but still I wouldn’t recommend it to be used since it is quite suspicious and the author hasn’t kept it up to date.</p>\n<p><em>This was the fourth assignment of <a href=\"http://terokarvinen.com/2020/ict-security-basics-from-trust-to-blockchain-itc4hm003-3001-2020-spring/\">ICT Security Basics</a>.</em></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>In this post I’ll try out four different WebGoat assignments and analyze them in relation to OWASP 10 and the real world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-an-access-control-matrix\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using an Access Control Matrix <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/webgoat-access-control-flaws-and-dangers-of-eval/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This assignment can be solved just by trying out different users and finding out which of them can access Account Manager. The answer is Larry.</p>\n<p>This is a OWASP 10 Broken Authentication problem because any user can assume the role of Larry just by trying out.</p>\n<p>Similar kind of vulnerability could be found on any system where access is not restricted with password or similar mechanism. For example on my <a href=\"https://www.lennu.net/security-incident-of-zoom-video-conferences-video-files-found-from-a-search-engine/\">Zoom incident post</a> there was a case that just by knowing the URL the adversary could watch private videos. In my opinion this is a very common issue and secrets are lying around in the internet for any explorer to find.</p>\n<p>This could easily be prevented by protecting private information with passwords or some other authentication mechanism. For example in this WebGoat exercise there should’ve been a password field and a server side check for it before revealing the access to Account Manager.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bypass-a-path-based-access-control-scheme\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bypass a Path Based Access Control Scheme <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/webgoat-access-control-flaws-and-dangers-of-eval/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The idea here is to access private file called <code>WEB-INF/spring-security.xml</code> in the underlying filesystem. As I knew that this file would probably be somewhere under the current directory where the software is running I just tried different lengths of sub directory command. This can be achieved by modifying the Document object model with browser developer tools. Change one of the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements in <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> to have value of <code>../../../../../WEB-INF/spring-security.xml</code> and select and click View File.</p>\n<p>This is a OWASP 10 Broken Access Control issue because server lets users access files outside the web directory.</p>\n<p>This could be used very maliciously by an attacker to find out private information from the server. For example to look for database files and downloading them from the server. I think it used to be more common but now a lot of the web frameworks in use protect users automatically from this.</p>\n<p>It can be prevented by using <code>.htaccess</code> file by configuring the users to only have access to certain directories. Also it is necessary to have proper role and user management active within the software that is used to publish such websites. Lastly one shouldn’t make such programs that directly point to file paths withing the system. The accessible files should be saved to a database for example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bypass-presentational-layer-access-control\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bypass Presentational Layer Access Control <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/webgoat-access-control-flaws-and-dangers-of-eval/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In this WebGoat assignment the user Tom needs to be deleted. I found it quite easy and mostly guessed that by changing the value of the button you can send different commands to the server. You login to Tom’s account and go to ViewProfile where you open browser’s developer tools and edit the button of EditProfile. Change button’s value from <code>EditProfile</code> to <code>DeleteProfile</code> and click the button.</p>\n<p>As the title says this is OWASP 10 Broken Access Control issue.</p>\n<p>I think this vulnerability doesn’t come visible to normal users as it requires code modifications but in real life this can be done very easily. For example it could be interesting to go important services like bank websites and try this out. There could be any actions available for the user they didn’t know of. For example <code>GiveAdminPermissions</code> could be nice. As was stated before Broken Access Control is usually protected by good frameworks but mistakes do happen and something like this where user has greater access to the software happen probably quite often.</p>\n<p>Modifying the source code of a website can be considered a malicious attempt and it’s important to protect against these kind of security issues. This can be ensured by making sure logged in users are assigned only the privileges they need. Software should follow least privilege principle which means in practice that software developer should start always from zero privileges when creating a role and give privileges when needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dangerous-use-of-eval\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dangerous Use of Eval <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/webgoat-access-control-flaws-and-dangers-of-eval/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In this WebGoat task the mission is to inject code into the web browser. The requirement is to use alert to view document.cookie. I looked into the code and found out a clue that the software is using eval. The solution is to insert <code>543');alert(document.cookie);('</code> into the three digit access code input field.</p>\n<p>This is a classic OWASP 10 Cross-Site Scripting XSS issue. In this task we are running malicious code on the users browser to view cookie information.</p>\n<p>If some mechanism allows the attacked to modify users browser then in real life an attacker could for example send data from the browser or modify the browser so that user would do something harmful. Also any kind of intrusion the organizations web pages is very harmful as it shows weakened security in the organization. This kind of issues come and go since web browsers protect users many of the common cross-site scripting issues but web developer can accidentally build such vulnerabilities for the attackers.</p>\n<p>Companies may protect against this kind of issue by ensuring code quality is good and all external libraries and use of them is identified and researched. Adversaries are interested of web pages where there are a lot of traffic and try find all the security holes available. Also the use of eval should be forbidden in any user initiated context as its very insecure function.</p>\n<p><em>This was the third assignment of <a href=\"http://terokarvinen.com/2020/ict-security-basics-from-trust-to-blockchain-itc4hm003-3001-2020-spring/\">ICT Security Basics</a>.</em></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>The way of operationally approaching ICT security discussions with executives has become obsolete. Operational means acting on threats, vulnerabilities, risks and audits as they come and interacting with the organization with references to the details of the security issues. This style of approach is valid for smaller organizations but even for small organizations it can become quite overwhelming.</p>\n<p>This style of approach can be considered bad because it is not valued in the organization. Executives of an organization doesn’t care what security issues are handled and how. They care that the security is good and it doesn’t affect the business. New security standards can be expensive and difficult to manage. Organizations usually think that these are just something the security people invent as they can’t see the profit in them. Operational approach doesn’t reveal the true purpose of why these changes must be made.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strategic-approach\" tabindex=\"-1\">Strategic approach <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/strategic-approach-on-ict-security/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Strategic approach can be seen more as an co-operative way of handling ICT security within the organization. Strategic approach means that the security issues are identified and reported in relation to the assets they are supposed to protect. This kind of approach merges security to the business.</p>\n<p>The key to approaching security on strategic way is to communicate within the organization how security issues are related to the business the organization does. Instead of talking about hacker codes and certificate names in strategic approach the security experts should be focusing on how the business benefits from these security related matters. The approach can be followed by working together and discussing how some ICT security related issue can be resolved within the organization.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem of operational approach is that every security related matter is a problem. Strategic approach is a new perspective of looking at ICT security for the whole organization. It should make ICT security seen as a vital part of the organization, and not just stack of problems handled one by one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"business-case-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Business case example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/strategic-approach-on-ict-security/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Organization XYZ has security issues every month. Most of the issues are non-updated software that has severe security issues in them. Hackers and other bad actors have caused multiple interruptions to the business of XYZ and it has began to affect negatively on their customer experience and overall happiness.</p>\n<p>XYZ’s security team is dealing with the issues one by one and reporting the incidents and updated software to the managers as completed tasks. New standards and updates are coming weekly and security team has hard time finding the time to complete these issues. The organization doesn’t value the work of the security team because there seems to be more issues all the time and the required time and funds seems to be spent on wrong things because there’s still security issues all the time.</p>\n<p>Some queries come from the software department who are in need of auditing systems and asking for guidance. The security team can only answer briefly with incomplete answers and usually says “no” to every inquiry about a new feature to come. Software development team also hides some of the security related matters and pieces of software from the security team as they don’t trust their expertise and doesn’t value their negative attitude and input to the inquiries.</p>\n<p>XYZ’s security team has to change and especially change how the organization sees their value and input to the organization’s security matters, and how the organization sees their value inside the organization. The security team decides to try to change their approach from their old way of operation approach to more strategic approach.</p>\n<p>They first start by changing how they report and discuess the security issues they have handled within the organization. They report them as not fixing a certain problem but more like ensuring that the business wasn’t affected by the this certain security issue.</p>\n<p>Next they create an investment map that shows how the security matters have affected and will affect in the future to the business. The map has invest costs of and their value in possible lost revenue if these are not executed with information which parts of the organization this affects.</p>\n<p>They change their approach to the software development and business by entering the business discussions and inserting security as a merged part of every business project. They’ll have dedicated security experts within software development teams and also make their way to the executive boards. They start the auditing processes of systems very early on and make less use of third party audit companies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"outcomes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Outcomes <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/strategic-approach-on-ict-security/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Organization XYZ still has some security issues but they have managed to tackle most of them. By integrating ICT security to the business and development endeavors the security team has established their value and place withing the organization.</p>\n<p>Their change of approach has given the executives more visibility of the ICT security and even some new knowledge about the matter. The security team has a board member who translates many of the issues to the other executives. The ICT security map helps the team and the whole organization by having clear vision what things in security are important and which can be done on a later date.</p>\n<p>The development teams has new trust for the security team and think security is part of the software development. They usually do security related issues before the security experts get a chance to notify them which means that the software development is interested to protect their software and has learned a lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2020/strategic-approach-on-ict-security/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In my opinion operational approach is something every organization should avoid because it’s not capable of handling security issues and the organization can’t get any valuable insight from that approach to help in decision making. Strategic approach is much better translating problems and the fact that security is a vital part of every business.</p>\n<p>Strategic approach is something that requires a bit of work form the management of ICT security but it’s also something that pays off easily to the rest of the organization. Well structured ICT security within the organization is something that is known and valued throughout the organization, and that is also how ICT security works best and can affect the organization in the most positive ways.</p>\n<p><em>This was the second assignment of <a href=\"http://terokarvinen.com/2020/ict-security-basics-from-trust-to-blockchain-itc4hm003-3001-2020-spring/\">ICT Security Basics</a>.</em></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>TOGAF is a enterprise architecture standard that is fully free and open for any organization to use. It is developed by The Open Group and the first version was published in 1995. The standard is full and works fine on its own but most organizations tend to use just parts of it or just certain part to fill their enterprise architecture models. The development group consists of a wide spectrum and the result represents the needs of the whole community of these stakeholders.</p>\n<p>TOGAF standard defines enterprise architecture to four domains that are usually found from other enterprise architecture standards too and widely accepted as the common subsets. The business architecture which consists of business models and processes. The data architecture which consists of all data objects and assets the organization holds. The application architecture which consists of applications, how they are deployed, where they are deployed, how they work together and how they are related to business. The technology architecture consists of overview of software and hardware and how they relate and work within the previous domains.</p>\n<p>TOGAF provides a method for developing the TOGAF standardized architectures. The method is used for creating a new architecture, developing already established, moving from one architecture to another and monitoring how architecture is developing. The method is simply defining and inspecting the results of the created architecture with response to business objectives. The method is similar to agile development methodologies where the development processes are continuous and iterative cycle. However as it is a controlled development method it has phases which define the continuous cycle. The phases go from the preliminary phase which describes the architecture principles and architecture vision to through the specific domains and their development and migration phases.</p>\n<p>The TOGAF architecture content framework is a model for all the content that is produced during the continuous architecture building process. During the process mentioned above there are a lot of material that is produced. This material can quickly end up unresolvable and by using the content framework is is ensured that the materials don’t get mixed up.</p>\n<p>The previously mentioned are the main points of TOGAF but there are a lot of more to TOGAF. Enterprise continuum is a way to classify architectures and their documents into a wider context. Architecture repository is store for all the outputs and creations of the architecture development method. TOGAF architecture capability is a model to define the organization roles and properties in order to ensure enterprise architecture is deployed and correctly used all around the organization. TOGAF provides a first class standard for creating, maintaining and developing enterprise architectures. Most enterprise architecture standards focus on what are the deliverables of the architecture. The difference with TOGAF is that it focuses a lot into the architecture development method and how the using organization gets to create the architecture the need. The generic approach of TOGAF ensures it suits well to majority of use cases and it doesn’t restrict itself by generalizing the architecture and the deliverables to a too strict boundaries.</p>\n",

			"title": "Historical evolution of analytics",
			"content_html": "<p>The first occurrences of analysis of statistics are found from the 19th century by Frederick Winslow Taylor who performed time management exercises. Even Henry Ford took some interest into the assembly lines and how performant they were. The breakthrough came in the 1970s when Edgar F. Codd created relational databases which held mostly structured data and allowed users for retrieve the data by writing SQL. These kind of databases and SQL are still very much in use even today.</p>\n<p>With the Internet there was a big need for storing different kinds of data and this wasn’t the area for relational databases which are not very good at translating unstructured data into searchable. NoSQL databases followed this development with their ease of usage and very good flexibility. NoSQL systems then led into the era of big data and all the things around it. In the ever growing era of the Internet many organizations started to go online and they had perfect opportunity to start to collect data. In the late 2000s there was a great need for software that could serve as platform for all of the data gathered. This is also the time when business analytics started to get really popular. With all the data the organizations started to improve their businesses by making decisions based on data which is called business intelligence. Business intelligence was known from the late 1980s but it hadn’t made its way properly and was waiting for the right tools.</p>\n<p>Currently the latest tools of analytics are in the cloud. Cloud services rent services rather than selling you them for good. They offer endless data warehouses and tools for data mining and other analytic endeavours.</p>\n<p>Business analytics is more about looking at the data and inspecting why something happened even to predict or assume something about the future. Business intelligence is looking at the data and seeing the events leading up to something and not so much about why these events were taken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-data-visualization\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is data visualization? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2019/historical-evolution-of-analytics/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Visualizing the data collected is the easiest way to understand it. When an organization has a lot of data and they want to explore it or get “see it” it is easiest done by visualizing it. This usually means creating graphs, maps or charts. The latest ways of displaying data or visualizing it are usually full of information. The graphs are interactive and even update while looked at, some even allow you to do deeper analysis of them.</p>\n<p>Visualization can be done with well known Microsoft Excel but this is rather old and dull way of representing data. Now there are business intelligence platforms such as Tableau or Qlik which focus heavily on visualization and allowing the user to pick and choose the data which is interesting. Visualization is important to humans and especially data scientists since it’s easy for us to recognize that something is going as planned from a graph rather than looking at the raw data.</p>\n<p>There are dashboards everywhere now and there are new use cases all the time. Some businesses might be looking at click through rate of a webpage and some might be looking at the performance indicators of company. It’s increasingly popular to automate the data visualization and let the system create the graphs and pictures for you. The data behind the systems have started to understand different kinds of data and are usually ready to offer the best insights that the user should be looking at in their dashboard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-machine-learning\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is machine learning? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2019/historical-evolution-of-analytics/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Machine learning is a way to make systems learn from their experiences. In other words its a way to use data to make predictions.</p>\n<p>To be able to teach a machine, one would require a lot of data. This data is poured into a software that is an algorithm that tries to figure out the wanted outcome. This algorithm may have been given instructions of the matter and how to react to different cases of the data. Or it might be completely free of rules and the purpose of the algorithm is just to find out patterns of the given data.</p>\n<p>Features in machine learning are the facts about the subject and output variables are the facts that have been calculated from these features. Instance is a combination of these two – a single instance of the training data.</p>\n<p>For example you could have a vast collection of pictures of animals and some data with them. Some of them are pictures of a cat and the other ones are pictures of a dog. The images come with their features such as the subspecies of the animal, where it’s from, how old is it, the shape of the animal and the colors of it. The output variable or variables are then the fact that is this a picture of a cat or a dog. These images, their features and the output data are called the training data. Now the machine goes through this data and has some kind of an answer (model) what a cat might look like. When you enter another picture of a cat into the algorithm the machine can try to guess based on the earlier data was the picture taken of a cat or not.</p>\n<p>Machine learning is a very important and developing part of business analytics because it is one form of artificial intelligence and can help with decision making within the business. A business might want to know what a certain customer is keen on doing next in a website. This business could create a machine learning model of all of the previous users’ behaviors. Next when a customer visits their website the behavior of that single customer is inserted into the algorithm and the website kind of guides the user to go to the next thing that the algorithm predicts the user would want to go to. These kind of applications make machine learning a powerful tool within business analytics.</p>\n",

This might happen if you have in a monorepo environment or some similar situation.</p>\n<p>This error is actually good one because usually you shouldn’t have tests within your build.</p>\n<p>The errors you might get could be something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>ERROR in [at-loader] ./src/somefile.spec.tsx:2:25\nTS2307: Cannot find module 'enzyme'.\\n\\nERROR in [at-loader] ./src/somefile.spec.tsx:3:26\nTS2307: Cannot find module 'enzyme-to-json'.\n \n﻿ERROR in [at-loader] ./src/somefile.spec.tsx:6:1\nTS2304: Cannot find name 'describe'.\\n\\nERROR in [at-loader] ./src/somefile.spec.tsx:7:3\nTS2304: Cannot find name 'it'.\n \nERROR in [at-loader] ./src/somefile.spec.tsx:10:5\nTS2304: Cannot find name 'expect'.\n \nERROR in [at-loader] ./src/somefile.spec.tsx:14:5\nTS2304: Cannot find name 'jest'.\n</code></pre>\n<p>So to fix the situation and remove the errors you have to exclude the spec files from the build. This should be done through typescript configuration (tsconfig.json). With the following style:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n...\n  &quot;exclude&quot;: [\n    &quot;./src/**/*.spec.ts\\&quot;,\n    &quot;./src/**/*.spec.tsx\\&quot;,\n    &quot;node_modules\\&quot;,\n    &quot;./dist/\\&quot; &amp;lt;- or whatever you'r outDir path is\n  ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remember that exclude array defaults to these locations:<br>\nnode_modules, bower_components, jspm_packages and .</p>\n",

It’s a great tool to use when you already know which ASINs (products) you want to work with. In this post I assume you want to fetch product information for multiple items and have the list of ASINs ready in a text file, separated by a new line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\" tabindex=\"-1\">The problem <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2017/how-to-use-php-and-amazon-api-to-fetch-product-information/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Many people want to fetch Amazon product information for their websites. They have review sites, comparison sites, blogs about certain subject where Amazon products are displayed (with affiliate links, of course). Often basic information like name and image are enough, but sometimes you want more detailed data. Scraping all product data off Amazon website might’ve occurred to you. But web scraping is rather unreliable and not approved by Amazon. In fact, you are risking your Amazon Associates account if you are publishing scraped content. So, how to retrieve that valuable information for Amazon products if not with web scraping?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\" tabindex=\"-1\">The solution <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2017/how-to-use-php-and-amazon-api-to-fetch-product-information/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Use Amazon API! After you have a list of ASINs at your disposal the API is a very handy tool. You can retrieve a lot of information with it, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price</li>\n<li>Discount amount and percentage</li>\n<li>Availability</li>\n<li>Images</li>\n<li>UPC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cool, isn’t it? So let’s see what you need…</p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\" tabindex=\"-1\">Requirements <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2017/how-to-use-php-and-amazon-api-to-fetch-product-information/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Web server with PHP enabled</li>\n<li>ASIN list (text file, one ASIN per line)</li>\n<li>Amazon Associates account (<a href=\"http://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/apply/main.html\">get it here</a>)</li>\n<li>Amazon Product Advertising API enabled (<a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/flex/advertising/api/sign-in.html\">enable it here</a>)</li>\n<li>Amazon API PHP class (<a href=\"http://www.codediesel.com/downloads/amazonapi\">get it from here</a> thanks to <a href=\"http://www.codediesel.com/\">Sameer Borate</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opening up Amazon Associates account should be easy and fast. Just go here and follow the instructions. It could take a few days to get you approved – but in my experience, most people are accepted. Just remember to have some kind of a website ready with original content. And preferably give accurate information because they’re going to send you check / deposit money to your bank account after you start generating money (which is, by the way, not so hard with Amazon Associates program). Anyway, in the process you’ll also make a Tracking ID which is used to track the visitors you send to Amazon. Keep that at hand, you’ll need it later.</p>\n<p>Once you have enabled Amazon API on your account, you must create Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. They are the keys that the Amazon API PHP script will use to authenticate with Amazon API servers. You can get the keys here. Just click on Access Keys -&gt; Create New Access Key. You’ll be presented with a box saying an access key has been successfully created for you. Click Download Key File and save it on your computer. This is important because once you close the pop-up, you can’t retrieve the secret access key again from your Amazon API account settings.</p>\n<p>Next, upload <a href=\"http://www.codediesel.com/downloads/amazonapi\">the two files</a> (amazon_api_class.php and aws_signed_request.php) to your web server’s public_html or its subdirectory. You don’t have to modify the latter, but slight modifications have to be made for the class file itself. So open up amazon_api_class.php and find lines 42, 49 and 57 and do as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On line 42, put your Access Key ID inside the double quotes. Remember, you downloaded the keys to your computer above.</li>\n<li>On line 49, put your Secret Access Key inside the double quotes.</li>\n<li>On line 57, put your Tracking ID inside the double quotes. You can see it <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/main.html\">here</a> on upper right corner (Store) after logging in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Great, now you have the PHP class ready. It’s time to look at the actual source code of the file that will fetch detailed product information for every ASIN in your list. Put the following code to the same directory you put the amazon_api_class.php and aws_signed_request.php to and run the code.</p>\n<p>PHP Code:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n        \n        // Open the list of ASINs for reading\n        $handle = fopen(&quot;asins.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);\n        \n        // Include the Amazon API PHP class\n        include(&quot;amazon_api_class.php&quot;);\n \n        // Create a new Amazon API object\n        $obj = new AmazonProductAPI();\n        \n        // Start looping through the ASIN file, line by line\n        while (($asin = fgets($handle)) !== false) {\n        \n            // Remove the new line from ASIN\n            $asin = str_replace(&quot;\\n&quot;,&quot;&quot;,$asin);\n \n            // Try to fetch product information with the object\n            try {\n                $result = $obj-&gt;getItemByAsin($asin);\n            }\n            // If unsuccesful, catch the exception...\n            catch(Exception $e)\n            {\n                // And print it to the screen\n                echo $e-&gt;getMessage();\n            }\n            \n            // To see the whole response (with all the information, uncomment\n            // the following three lines\n            // echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;;\n            // print_r($result);\n            // echo &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;; */\n            \n            // Get title, price and image URL from the response\n            $title = $result-&gt;Items-&gt;Item-&gt;ItemAttributes-&gt;Title;\n            $price = $result-&gt;Items-&gt;Item-&gt;OfferSummary-&gt;LowestNewPrice-&gt;FormattedPrice;\n            $image_url = $result-&gt;Items-&gt;Item-&gt;LargeImage-&gt;URL;\n            \n            // Print the title, price, ASIN and image URL to screen\n            echo &quot;$asin Title: $title&lt;br /&gt;$asin Price: $price&lt;br /&gt;$asin Image URL: $image_url&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;\n            \n            // Wait 1 second because of Amazon API call limit\n            // Adjust it to your liking, more info here:\n            // https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/faq.html\n            sleep(1);\n        \n        // End of ASIN\n        }\n        \n        // Close the ASIN text file\n        fclose($handle);\n        \n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>So what’s happening there?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We open the ASIN text file (called asins.txt in this example) with read mode on.</li>\n<li>We include Amazon API PHP class.</li>\n<li>We create a new Amazon API object.</li>\n<li>We start while loop with fgets that returns a new line from ASINs file and puts it to variable $asin.</li>\n<li>We remove new line (\\n) from the end of the ASIN.</li>\n<li>We initiate try-catch statement and try to use getItemByAsin function from the Amazon API PHP class. If successful, we continue. If not, we catch the exception and print the message to screen.</li>\n<li>I commented out the full response, but you can uncomment lines 31-33 to see the full response and pick the product information you want.</li>\n<li>Next we fetch the product’s title, price and image URL from the response object. That’s done by retrieving paths from the object with the -&gt; operator.</li>\n<li>We echo the information to screen. You can replace the line 41 with whatever you want (for example, insert the retrieved information to database), but to make it simple in this example we just echo it.</li>\n<li>We sleep (wait) one second. This is because of Amazon API’s call limits. If you’ve generated sales in the past 30 days you can reduce the waiting time. <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/faq.html\">Read more about it here</a>.</li>\n<li>We are at the end of line (ASIN), move on to the next one and start from the beginning of while loop. If this is the last line from the ASIN file, move to next line in the code.</li>\n<li>We finally close the ASIN file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not so hard, isn’t it. This way you can retrieve plenty of information from the Amazon API for your projects. This is 100% Terms of Services compliant way to do it. I’ve also found out that the API is reliable and doesn’t experience lags or other oddities. But there are some things to keep in mind…</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\" tabindex=\"-1\">Caveats <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2017/how-to-use-php-and-amazon-api-to-fetch-product-information/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes the price returned is “price too low to display” rather than actual price. This is not a bug but a feature of the API. <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/minimum-advertised-price.html\">Read more about it here</a>. The only way to go around this would be to scrape the price from their website rather than using the API. But web scraping Amazon, especially the price information, is forbidden by their Terms of Services. If you publish scraped information, your Amazon Associates account could get banned.</li>\n<li>You can’t return customer reviews or star ratings with the API. You can, however, return a link to the customer reviews. But that’s not very often the desired option. Again, web scraping Amazon product pages would give you the customer reviews, but publishing them would break copyright laws and the Terms of Services. So don’t do it.</li>\n<li>There’s a call limit for Amazon API. That means you can only do certain amount of API calls in a second. If you haven’t generated any sales in the past 30 days, the default limit is one call per second. But when you generate sales for Amazon (and commission for yourself), the API limit changes. <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/faq.html\">Read more about it here</a>.</li>\n<li>Not every product’s information can be retrieved through the API. I’m not sure exactly why some products are off limits for the API. But that’s how it is. I’ve seen at least some “discontinued by manufacturer” products not working with the API. But rest assured that 99% of the time the product information can be retrieved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all I can think for now. Amazon API is a good, reliable tool for programmatically fetching product data. You can use use it to build sites and with some creativity, perhaps even profitable ones!</p>\n",

			"title": "Doctrine Many To Many with Extra Fields",
			"content_html": "<p>Extra fields for Many to Many relationship is usually well supported. However in Doctrine this is actually something that you can’t do with just normal ManyToMany entity.</p>\n<p>In Doctrine you have to define three Entities where you kind of manually create the Many To Many relationship. This is done like this.</p>\n<p>Lets say we have Products and Categories. Products can have many Categories and Categories can have many Products. So we need a many to many relationship.</p>\n<p>Now for the sake of example we also need quantity of how many products are in a category. It would be convenient to store the information into the middle table of our many to many relationship.</p>\n<p>Lets first define the Product class</p>\n<pre><code>namespace Entity;\n \nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\n \n/**\n * @ORM\\Entity()\n * @ORM\\Table(name=&quot;product&quot;)\n */\nclass Product\n{\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /**\n     * @ORM\\Id()\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;integer&quot;)\n     */\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private $id;\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /**\n     * ORM\\Column(name=&quot;name&quot;, type=&quot;string&quot;, length=50, nullable=false)\n     */\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private $name;\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /**\n     * @ORM\\OneToMany(targetEntity=&quot;Entity\\CategoryProduct&quot;, mappedBy=&quot;product&quot;)\n     */\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private $categoryProducts;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So you see that we are using <strong>OneToMany</strong> relationship in here and it is targeting Entity CategoryProducts which eventually will be our middle table.</p>\n<p>Now lets define Category class:</p>\n<pre><code>namespace Entity;\n \nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\n \n/**\n&amp;nbsp;* @ORM\\Entity()\n&amp;nbsp;* @ORM\\Table(name=&quot;store&quot;)\n&amp;nbsp;*/\nclass Store\n{\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /**\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * @ORM\\Id()\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;integer&quot;)\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; */\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private $id;\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /**\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * ORM\\Column(name=&quot;name&quot;, type=&quot;string&quot;, length=50, nullable=false)\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; */\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private $name;\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /**\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * @ORM\\OneToMany(targetEntity=&quot;Entity\\CategoryProduct&quot;, mappedBy=&quot;category&quot;)\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; */\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private $categoryProducts;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have defined both of our main entities.

We can also add here as many extra fields as we like. Currently this entity contains the <strong>Quantity</strong> which will store the information of how many products are in this category.</p>\n",

			"title": "Native JavaScript Promise Example with Prompt",
			"content_html": "<p>JavaScript on modern browsers has a native support for promises. And the greatest thing is that the syntax is very easy.</p>\n<p>Basically you can use promises for anything but they are at their best with asynchronous actions. For example ajax, user input, timeout. In this example we are using native JavaScript dialog: <strong>prompt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Lets first check out the basic syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  if (true) {\n    resolve('Message')\n  }\n  else {\n    reject('Error message for catch')\n  }\n})\n \np.then(function(message) { \n  console.log(message)\n  return 'Another message'\n})\n.then(function(anotherMessage) {\n  console.log(anotherMessage)\n})\n.catch(function(error) {\n  console.log(error)\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also chain the whole thing like this:</p>\n<pre><code>new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  if (true) {\n    resolve('Message')\n  }\n  else {\n    reject('Error message for catch')\n  }\n})\n.then(function(message) {\n  console.log(message)\n  return 'Another message'\n})\n.then(function(anotherMessage) {\n  console.log(anotherMessage)\n})\n.catch(function(error) {\n  console.log(error)\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or cut it to small functions:</p>\n<pre><code>new Promise(myPromise)\n.then(message)\n.then(anotherMessage)\n.catch(handleError)\n \nfunction myPromise(resolve, reject) {\n  if (true) {\n    resolve('Message')\n  }\n  else {\n    reject(&quot;Error message for catch&quot;)\n  }\n}\n \nfunction message(message) {\n  console.log(message)\n  return 'Another message'\n}\n \nfunction anotherMessage(anotherMessage) {\n  console.log(anotherMessage)\n}\n \nfunction handleError(error) {\n  console.log(error)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here I have made a little script that generates Alphabet squares. First it asks for user input and then creates rows and finally prints them. If user’s input is invalid it will get caught in error handling.</p>\n<p>The final result gives you alphabet squares depending on the size of the number. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>AAAAA\nABBBA\nABCBA\nABBBA\nAAAAA\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>var ALPHABET = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'Å', 'Ä', 'Ö']\n new Promise(getUserInput)\n .then(createRows)\n .then(printRows)\n .catch(handleError)\n function getUserInput(resolve, reject) {\n   var userInput = parseInt(window.prompt(&quot;Give number between 1-26.&quot;,&quot;3&quot;))\n   if (!userInput || userInput &amp;lt; 1 || userInput &gt; 26) {\n   reject(&quot;Number should be between 1-26.&quot;)\n }\n   resolve(userInput)\n }\n function printRows(rows) {\n   rows.forEach(function(row) { console.log(row) })\n }\n function handleError(e) { console.log(e) }\n function createRows(size) {\n   var rows = []\n   for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; size; i++) {     rows.push(createSingleRow(i, size))   }   for (var i = size; i &gt; 0; i--) {\n     rows.push(createSingleRow(i, size))\n   }\n   return rows\n }\n function createSingleRow(index, size) {\n   var rowAlphabet = ALPHABET.slice(0, index)\n   var row = &quot;&quot;\n   for (var j = 0; j &amp;lt; size; j++) {\n     row += rowAlphabet[j] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; j &amp;lt; size\n     ? rowAlphabet[j]\n     : row.slice(-1)\n   }\n   return row + reverseString(row.slice(0, row.length-1))\n }\n function reverseString(s) { return s.split('').reverse().join('') }\n</code></pre>\n",

The syntax of jQuery is made very easy to read and it is most often the first JavaScript library that a new web developer becomes familiar with.</p>\n<p>You can select elements from a web page, create animations, add and modify events and create ajax functionalities. This is jQuery from google hosted content delivery network:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is a script that you can insert into the source of a website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\" tabindex=\"-1\">Overview <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/what-is-jquery-and-how-to-use-it/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Under the tree jQuery is DOM (Document Object Model) modifying library. For example, from a website you can find an element and change its color, modify text, increase font size, react to click events or hide the element. Everything that can be seen on a web page, can also be modified with jQuery.</p>\n<p>It is a really strong library if the DOM is wanted to be modified with ease and in a speedy fashion. It’s in usage in over half of available websites and the learning of it is really easy. The weakness of is the the its size. jQuery is a large library and a lot of things can be achieved by using it. But a lot of smaller libraries specified for exact usage do the same things in a better and more effective way.</p>\n<p>jQuery is at its best when the visible elements of a website must be modified dynamically. For example when a user clicks a button, jQuery reacts and shows something new to the user.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\" tabindex=\"-1\">Features <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/what-is-jquery-and-how-to-use-it/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The most important features of jQuery are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selection of DOM elements</li>\n<li>The manipulation of DOM</li>\n<li>Events</li>\n<li>Effects and animations</li>\n<li>Ajax</li>\n<li>Deferred and promise</li>\n<li>Extraction of JSON</li>\n<li>Building on top of jQuery</li>\n<li>Bringing modern technologies to old web browsers</li>\n<li>Support for most web browsers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two versions of jQuery.

			"title": "jQuery animate Example with CSS, Duration and Easing",
			"content_html": "<p>Animation is one of the key aspects of jQuery. It is such a big feature set that it has multiple different functions built inside jQuery library. jQuery animate is sort of custom function along with the other animation functions. You can animate almost any CSS style there is and create very good looking user interfaces by doing smooth transitions and effects according the to the actions made by the user.</p>\n<p>jQuery.animate() takes a set of parameters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>properties, an object containing CSS Styles</li>\n<li>duration, how long the animation should take</li>\n<li>easing, in which style should jQuery do the animation (<strong>easing can only be ‘swing’ which is default or ‘linear’</strong>)</li>\n<li>callback, a function that should be ran after the animation has completed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these parameters there are a lot of variety in the things you can implement with this function. The basic cases are usually simple but jQuery.animate() can be extended to be very powerful and multi-functional method.</p>\n<pre><code>$('selector').animate(\n  {\n    'css-property': 'value', // for example 'opacity': '0.5',\n  },\n  duration, // integer for example 2000\n  'swing', // here we only have two choices 'swing' and 'linear'\n  function(){\n    // What you want to do after the animation?\n  }\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As most of the time with jQuery, the function is applied to a specified selector or jQuery object. The animation can only affect the selection but the CSS properties could easily affect other elements on the page and change the look and feel dramatically.</p>\n<p>The set of CSS properties available and by this the set of things you can do it very vast. Because animate allows a lot of customization, you have to know what you want to do. It doesn’t strict you out to one particular thing but it lets you decide what needs to be done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\" tabindex=\"-1\">Examples <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/jquery-animate-example-with-css-duration-and-easing/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Lets do a simple example using all the parameters of jQuery animate. First we need a HTML structure that contain a div with some inline styling making the example more clear.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div style=&quot;background: red; width: 150px; height: 150px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"basic-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Basic example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/jquery-animate-example-with-css-duration-and-easing/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Now we need the actual animate function. I have specified the animation to do <strong>opacity changing</strong> which is a common task made with this function.</p>\n<pre><code>$('div').animate(\n  {\n    'opacity': '0.5',\n  },\n  1000,\n  'swing',\n  function() {\n  \t$('div').append('&lt;span&gt;Animation complete&lt;/span&gt;')\n  }\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now as we can see the CSS we have in there is very simple: turn the opacity of an element to 0.5. The animation should last for one second and the easing should be linear. The function will add a span with some text inside the red div when the animation has been completed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-styles-easing-and-arbitrary-values\" tabindex=\"-1\">Multiple styles, easing and arbitrary values <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/jquery-animate-example-with-css-duration-and-easing/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We could change multiple CSS properties at once in the same animation. We can also add individual animation easing to each property.</p>\n<pre><code>$('div').animate(\n  {\n    'opacity': ['0.5', 'swing'],\n    'width': ['250px', 'linear'],\n    'height: 'toggle'\n  },\n  1000,\n  function() {\n  \t$('body').append('&lt;span&gt;Animation complete&lt;/span&gt;')\n  }\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>We moved the jQuery selector to body in the callback function because, as you can see we used ‘toggle’ as our height value. This is a jQuery speciality that lets you write arbitrary values to properties and let jQuery handle the rest. These values can be: toggle, show and hide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"options\" tabindex=\"-1\">Options <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/jquery-animate-example-with-css-duration-and-easing/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You can also move from specified parameters to single options object. There are a lot of options that are not available in the first examples, most of them made specially for promise type of programming. For example with options you could add a <strong>start</strong> function for the animations to be ran before the animation sets in. Lets turn the third example to the option way.</p>\n<pre><code>$('div').animate(\n  {\n    'opacity': ['0.5', 'linear'],\n    'width': ['250px', 'swing'],\n    'height': 'toggle'\n  },\n  {\n    'duration': 1000,\n    'start': function() {\n      $('body').append('&lt;span&gt;Animation started&lt;/span&gt;')\n    },\n    'complete': function() {\n      $('body span').text('Animation completed')\n    },\n  }\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we append the span to the body in the beginning and when the animation has been completed the text of the span is modified. You can find a lot of these options from <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/animate/#animate-properties-options\">http://api.jquery.com/animate/#animate-properties-options</a>.</p>\n",

First define the HTML.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button id=&quot;show-login-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;login&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Have CSS where login is hidden on default and if show-login class is added to the body class we show login.</p>\n<pre><code>body.show-login #login {\n    display: block;\n}\n \n#login {\n    display: none;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally create an event listener that listens the button we defined earlier to have and click event that adds show-login class to body element.</p>\n<pre><code>$('#showlogin-button').on('click', function() {\n    $('body').addClass('show-login')\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This kind of behavior is possible with jQuery addClass and they make it very important tool for everyone to have and know.</p>\n",

You can find elements under a parent element and add the parent element also the list of elements.</p>\n<pre><code>$('selector').addBack()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically addBack takes the first selector and adds this to the final group of elements.</p>\n<p>Find a div and search buttons under it with addBack function: $(‘div’).find(‘button’).addBack(‘button’).<br>\nYou’ll end up with a group consisting of these elements [div, button, button, button, button, …].

In normal situation the children elements were the ones that would be chosen to the jQuery element array. However when there is the last addBack function, also the first also known as the parent selector gets to the list of elements.</p>\n<p>For example there could be a list with five elements in it. The third one is important and it has been given its own ID. jQuery finds this element by looking for its ID. When we have found this element we want to find all the list items that follow it, the fourth and fifth. This can be done with nextAll function. When we use addBack with nextAll we can collect all three elements. After we have collected the list of elements we can pain their background to red.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;important&quot;&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;4&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;5&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\nvar elements = $('#important').nextAll().addBack()\nelements.css('background', red)\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>AddBack is not very common function, but it has its own little need and place of usage. It is very useful when we want to search elements from a long DOM tree but still keep the original parent element chosen.</p>\n",

If it helps you here is the way:</p>\n<pre><code>public static function nameOfTheFunction() {\n    $doSomething = null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The right way in Symfony if to serve the class as a service.</p>\n<p>Go to your services file in app/config/services.yml and append the following there, make sure that you are appending the controller you need to serve:</p>\n<pre><code>app.your_controller_service:\n    class: AppBundle\\Controller\\YourController\n        calls:\n            - [setContainer, [&quot;@service_container&quot;]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now in our another controller which needs the <strong>services</strong> of this controller we can call with this command:</p>\n<pre><code>$some = $this-&gt;get('app.your_controller_service')-&gt;getSomeAction($passSomeParameters);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats it!</p>\n",

			"title": "Symfony vs Laravel – The Battle of Old and New",
			"content_html": "<p>Question that arise for many new projects with PHP as their main back end language which web framework should I choose. How can you make a decision between Symfony and Laravel?</p>\n<p>These two PHP web frameworks are currently the two most used. They have a lot in common and Laravel actually uses some parts of Symfony, but in the end its a world of its own. Even though they have a lot in common, they also differ in many ways from each other. The basic object oriented model and model view controller pattern is in the heart of both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"symfony\" tabindex=\"-1\">Symfony <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/symfony-vs-laravel/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Symfony has been a very successful web framework because it has successfully modularized itself and allow a lot of freedom in style. You can only use certain parts of Symfony and not follow the “Symfony” way of doing things. Symfony also extends greatly and has great documentation and large user base to support you.</p>\n<p>It is easy to integrate into and can stand as a solid structure around your old code base. Symfony has a lot of ways of doing things and as the framework doesn’t really strict you to one way, you can choose your own path. This is the biggest concern for new Symfony projects. Because there really is no mandatory structure you can do what ever you want and end in chaotically structured application. The basis is also kinda old and there aren’t standardized REST guides to help you do modern structures for website.</p>\n<p>Speed of development in Symfony is good. You can rapidly develop a fully functioning little website with some little features. But when you get into a large system stage you’ll start to take a lot of time doing many things related to entities and their controllers. Because there is no one true way of doing things you can easily go wrong and push yourself back a good time.</p>\n<p>The best thing is also the worst. The easiness to do things in Symfony is a two edged sword, it might give you great results but in the other end might stab you in the back. To overcome these problems, try to separate code and structure it well. Follow the best practices and don’t let code turn into spaghetti.</p>\n<h2 id=\"laravel\" tabindex=\"-1\">Laravel <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/symfony-vs-laravel/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Laravel is the new kid on the block when it comes to PHP web frameworks. It is a young framework from 2011 and has gradually risen in to the peak positions of most followed and used web frameworks. Laravel is more web framework than Symfony. It offers very much tools and preferred ways of doing things. The user base is rising all the time and new versions with great documentation arise on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Laravel projects should be started as new projects as there is no clear integration possibilities to old code bases. Laravel lets you do a lot of things freely but also restricts you in a sort of way that you don’t end up in a chaotic situation. Laravel tries to keep your code base clean and well structured. Laravel is more modern framework and it has lots of modern tools attached to it. The templating system is pure and simple and combined with support for nodejs task processing, it offers very good front end solutions straight from the box.</p>\n<p>Laravel and its controllers are made for RESTful services. The framework tries to guide you into the REST world and you’ll probably end with good solution if you follow the official documentation.</p>\n<p>The development process is really rapid as you can use a lot of techniques featured in Laravel. These techniques and tools make the development fast and efficient. It kind of restricts you to one way but this way is a really good way of doing things.</p>\n<p>The best thing in Laravel really is that it makes you focus on structure and create good code. It doesn’t offer very much space of movement but more enough to do complicated things. To master the framework well you will have to through a long journey. But you can get started very very easily and you’ll go through amazing learning process into the Laravel world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/symfony-vs-laravel/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As we can notice from the reviews of the two there are one main factor that differs these two.</p>\n<p>The Symfony way is not really a way, it’s more a set of tools you can use to build your website. On the other hand Laravel is a way of doing things and doesn’t give you as much freedom.</p>\n<p>I have used both of them and personally I find Laravel to be more friendly and better web framework than Symfony. When going into Symfony and starting a project, you don’t really have one place to start the pieces are all over the place and there is no clear signaling to do things. You will find your own way and eventually end up refactoring a lot of code just because you didn’t know somethings you knew once your project gets to a more mature state. Laravel tries to keep you doing good and well structured code from the beginning and doesn’t allow you to go through the easiest route.</p>\n<p>With Symfony I’m sure you’ll learn a lot about programming in general while in Laravel you’ll sort of already a way of doing things. While the Laravel way is really good you don’t get the same experience as you would with Symfony. But because Laravel makes the development so rapid and don’t you do foolish things as easily, it is the clear winner for me when choosing a PHP web framework.</p>\n<p>I’ll just leave the current Google Trends chart here at the bottom. From this we can verify that Laravel has taken over a big part of the PHP world. The updates for Laravel seems to be good and the framework is really stable and production ready. So if you are trying to figure out which framework to go with, think about your project and what you want to achieve and how. Laravel makes rapid, solid and efficient development in Laravel way. But Symfony gives you more freedom.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Did you know that when you are writing JavaScript, most of the time you don’t actually need to use semicolon in the end of the line. In most programming languages semicolons are mandatory in the end of the line. But in more modern languages, like JavaScript, Python or Swift, this tradition has been cut off. These languages handle the the ending of a statement some other way.</p>\n<p>In JavaScript a line end is recognized as a ending for a statement. There are few special cases when this doesn’t happen and we will go through these in a bit.</p>\n<p>JavaScript semicolons are however a possibility which you can use. This makes is a bit harder to understand when you need them and when you don’t. But in my opinion it is better learn when you need them and when you don’t need them. That’s the way how you learn how JavaScript actually works and why it works that way.</p>\n<p>Most JavaScript programmers tend to always insert semicolon in the end of the line. This is mostly a habit and not an actual logical outcome. It is very rare that you should encounter a situation where code breaks or has unwanted behavior because you didn’t append a semicolon. There are some situations where this might happen and by learning them you can master JavaScript even better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"javascript-semicolon\" tabindex=\"-1\">JavaScript Semicolon <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/javascript-semicolons-are-not-necessary/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A new line ( \\n ) basically ends a statement.

This semicolon is also very noticeable because it is prepended so it kind of shines in there saying there is something going on here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/javascript-semicolons-are-not-necessary/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I recommend you all to try writing JavaScript without semicolons as it really makes you write better code. It is far more important to understand to understand the structures of JavaScript programming language than blindly append semicolons everywhere just to avoid an occasional error.</p>\n<p>You can now leave the semicolon in peace.</p>\n",

These are some examples about what the tasks usually are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compiling</strong> CSS with your favorite technology for example: Sass, LESS, Stylus</li>\n<li><strong>Minifying</strong> CSS</li>\n<li>Compiling JavaScript with your favorite bundler for example: Browserify, require.js, plain nodejs, or something else</li>\n<li>Minifying or <strong>Uglifying</strong> JavaScript</li>\n<li>Cleaning folders and moving files from one place to another</li>\n<li><strong>Watching</strong> for changes in a folder and start processes if changes happen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds cool right? There are a lot of tasks and automation you can achieve with Gulp. These tasks usually take a lot of time if needed to be done manually. The great thing with task runners is that when you do the tasks, everybody on the project can use them.

You can get it from here https://nodejs.org/en/.</p>\n<pre><code>npm init # go through the steps with enter, no need to answer anything\nnpm install gulp --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats it, now you should have an npm project and a gulp saved to it.

And no it is not a magic function to get divs side by side.</p>\n<p>If you have developed a website you have come a cross this CSS style. You have used it, it has made incredible layouts for you and in the end you really have had no clue why you are using it.This is the actual line you can write to the website CSS file.</p>\n<p>What does it do? This is a tough one…</p>\n<p>Lets look at this from a non web developer point of view.</p>\n<p>People have to do lines in order to get into their favourite places. But if you are a VIP you can get out of the line and walk straight to the door. If we have multiple VIPs then they have to create their own line.</p>\n<p>This is sort of what happens when you say float:left to an html element.</p>\n<p>You create a new line of elements into the current container, but remember this, VIPs are invisible to their surroundings, and so are floating elements. See the picture on top.</p>\n<p>If you try to create a border around your element container, floated elements are not counted into this container. Just like VIPs are not contained into a waiting line. You can insert floated element with other elements and they will wrap around it, but the floated element is not using space in your container, other elements are just avoiding it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-don-t-have-to-use-float-left-to-create-a-layout\" tabindex=\"-1\">You don’t have to use float left to create a layout <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2016/float-left-im-trying-to-explain-it/\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/the-mystery-of-css-float-property/\">Smashing Magazine</a> in 2009</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it were not for the CSS <code>float</code> property, CSS layouts would not be possible except using absolute and relative positioning</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is actually not true at all. At least not anymore.</p>\n<p>You can and you should create layouts without the floating thing. All major browsers ever since IE8 have had a possibility of displaying a block element as inline.</p>\n<p>The major problem web developers were trying to solve by using floating is the fact that block level elements don’t follow each other. Two divs (HTML Document Division Elements) cannot be next to one another. They are by default block elements.</p>\n<p>But hey, now you can make divs to be block level elements inline.</p>\n<p>Inline your elements and create any kind of layouts you want.</p>\n",

Make sure they have all same aspect radius and same size. I recommend using same size on Y-axis and on X-axis, something like 88x88px. Otherwise your icons may vary in size and cause hard to do styling in HTML.</p>\n<p>There are some projects which can converts your SVG files to a font file. In this example we are going to use <a href=\"http://endtwist.github.io/fontcustom/\">Font Custom</a>. To install it on Linux (I’m using Ubuntu) follow the next steps:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install fontforge eot\\-utils ttfautohint\n\nwget http://people.mozilla.com/~jkew/woff/woff-code-latest.zip\n\nunzip woff-code-latest.zip -d sfnt2woff &amp;&amp; cd sfnt2woff &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo mv sfnt2woff /usr/local/bin/\n\ngem install fontcustom\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or if you are on Mac OS X, use these:</p>\n<pre><code>brew install fontforge --with-python\n\nbrew install eot\\-utils\n\ngem install fontcustom\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when you have it installed on your machine you may convert the SVG files to the font. Use this simple example to use Font Custom:</p>\n<pre><code>fontcustom compile fontfolder --name my-icons\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just replace font folder to the one where your SVG images are and click enter. Font Custom will now create a folder my-icons and convert the SVG files to a font. There is a nice preview file also created by Font Custom.</p>\n<p>You can use the font by browsing to the just created folder and including my-icons.css to your website.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link href\\=&quot;my-icons.css&quot; rel\\=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type\\=&quot;text/css&quot;\\&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the HTML code you can now include your custom font by writing for example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;i class\\=&quot;icon-lightbulb&quot;\\&gt;&lt;/i\\&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The name is inherited from the SVG file names.</p>\n<p>Remember that in order to control the size of the custom fonts SVG image, you need to to apply font-size, not width or height.</p>\n",

Reduce is actually a great function which helps your coding a lot if you learn how to use and when to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce takes an array and applies something to each value and returns only one value.</strong> In our example we will apply an array of strings to be concatenated together.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax of Reduce is:</p>\n<pre><code>var x = ['b','c','d'].reduce(function(previous, current, index, array) {\n  return previous + current\n}, 'a')\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you specify array in the function parameters, you don’t have to include start (‘a’) value.

			"title": "Responsive or Mobile site",
			"content_html": "<p>There are currently two good options for websites to have mobile accessibility. The first one is to have one fully responsive site and the other one is to have own website for mobile users (m.example.com). Before deciding which one you should go for, consider the next subjects first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"one-responsive-web-site\" tabindex=\"-1\">One responsive web site <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/responsive-or-mobile-site/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is the number one choice of most websites these days. The simplicity of having only one website with only one content just makes it great choice for the majority of websites. If you don’t have plans to create content solely for mobile users, then this is your number one choice.</p>\n<p>Of course responsive sites also have drawbacks. For example the idea is to build your styling on your site so that it scales to every possible device and browser variation available on the market. Or if you happen to start having mobile only content, you need to design a logic on your site how to show desktop or mobile content.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only one content to be written and administrated</li>\n<li>The design of the site has to scale to majority of devices and browsers</li>\n<li>How to show desktop or mobile content to different users?\n<ul>\n<li>What about SEO, which one should you choose to show for Google?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mobile-site\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mobile site <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/responsive-or-mobile-site/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Separate mobile site seems to be the choice of big companies such which probably suggests to the fact that it is more expensive to build separate mobile site. These sites usually work in m.example.com subdomain where they have their own life and most often somewhat different design from the main website.</p>\n<p>Mobile only sites too have problems. When user is asked do they want to be connected to the mobile only site, users tend to feel that they these sites are somewhat narrowed down and not have all the functionalities which is often true. You just don’t have the resources to build as good site as your main page is. The content might be outdated or something is missing from the mobile site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two contents to manage</li>\n<li>The design can be a bit simpler and not to scale as much</li>\n<li>You can show different content to desktop or mobile users</li>\n<li>SEOwise it is a great option if you have mobile only content</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"so-which-one-do-i-choose\" tabindex=\"-1\">So, which one do I choose? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/responsive-or-mobile-site/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We still haven’t seen a site with d.example.com where you would have desktop only site in a subdomain. So choose fully responsive site or site with mobile subdomain.</p>\n<p>If I had a website with content that was supposed to be seen only by the mobile users then I would go for the subdomain option. For example if you had a gaming site where the game client would be different for desktop and mobile then it would a great pain to make the users browsers to choose which one should it pick. You could enter into flickering site where mobile content would suddenly be shown or have to be waited with loading spinners spinning until the browser has made up its mind.</p>\n<p>If I had a website with only one content, I would definitely go for one fully responsive site. There would be no point to create subdomain with the mobile site, since every website can be designed to mobile view, it can be a bit trouble for large sites but I think its worth it.</p>\n<p>Make sure you choose this before starting your new website, other wise you could end up in a terrible mess. It is also a bit hard to change it when the project is ongoing.</p>\n",

It is a collaboration tool between designers and developers. The main idea behind is that the designer can upload his or hers designs (mainly Sketch?) to the platform and all the details about it will be processed to easily viewable form. I as a developer have been using the application for a few months now on a daily basis and here are my thoughts about it.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/vccRAkS1Gi-850.avif 850w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/vccRAkS1Gi-850.webp 850w\"><img alt=\"Zeplin User Interface\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/vccRAkS1Gi-850.png\" width=\"850\" height=\"425\"></picture></p>\n<p>Zeplin allows the developer to see every detail of the design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"native-application-vs-web-application\" tabindex=\"-1\">Native application vs. Web application <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/zeplin-collaboration-tool-review/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I’m a Linux user so I have only tested the web application, but as far as I have seen other people use it, they have liked the experience on the native OS X application.</p>\n<p>If you are on Linux or Windows, you have use the web application in order to use Zeplin. I fancy the web anyway so I kinda like it being in my browser. I have used Zeplin mainly on Firefox where it works quite nice, some slowness here and there but overall fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-user-interface\" tabindex=\"-1\">The User Interface <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/zeplin-collaboration-tool-review/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The UI is very easy to follow and quite simple. Zeplin seems to be one page application where you are presented with three columns. On the left you have designs of certain project, on the center you’ll see the actual design, and on the right you have details area.</p>\n<p>You have the design on your screen and where ever you want to get more details, you on click on it. Pixels, colours, margins, borders, sizes, gradients, you name it. The only thing I have had some trouble have been the text areas where some details have been left out, and I have had to ask the designer for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"missing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Missing <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/zeplin-collaboration-tool-review/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There still a lot of work to be done to make it perfect. Maybe in the future we could see automatic CSS lines of certain things. For example Zeplin nicely displays shadows, even every angle of them. But they could also print out the actual box-shadow CSS code.</p>\n<p>Designers can put design assets into Zeplin, but we haven’t used the option since we always like to have our images fully optimized, and I don’t see a way to put those images into Zeplin. I may be wrong.</p>\n<p>It is funny sometimes to notice a flaw in the design when Zeplin displays all the pixels precisely. Design containing a list could have different margins on the items just because it is unnoticeable on the human eye. But you just have to find the middle value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zeplin\" tabindex=\"-1\">Zeplin <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/zeplin-collaboration-tool-review/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It is a unique idea, and it has made my job a lot easier due not having to interrupt designers all the time with details about the sketch. The pricing is very low, and you can use it for free if you keep your sketches on one project.</p>\n<p>Try it out at <a href=\"https://zeplin.io/\">https://zeplin.io/</a> I’m sure you will like it, if you do a lot of close designer developer collaboration.</p>\n",

It is a very smooth process and makes HTML code clean and separated from the PHP code.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/9wLXHbXL4k-917.avif 917w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/9wLXHbXL4k-917.webp 917w\"><img alt=\"PHP HTML code\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/9wLXHbXL4k-917.jpeg\" width=\"917\" height=\"136\"></picture></p>\n<p>Does this ring any bells?

If we look into the code we can see that the class has one function called <strong>format($template, $args),</strong> which converts HTML special chars on arguments that start with @. At the end we return <strong>strtr()</strong> which really is all we need.</p>\n<h3 id=\"syntax\" tabindex=\"-1\">Syntax <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/simple-php-template-engine/\">#</a></h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nclass spte {\n\n  public function format($template, $args) {\n\n    foreach ($args as $arg \\=\\&gt; $value) {\n\n      if ($arg\\[0\\] \\== '@') $args\\[$arg\\] \\= htmlspecialchars($value);\n\n    }\n\n    return strtr($template, $args);\n\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>SPTE is basically a php class which you can include to your favourite PHP file and use it with following syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>include\\_once('spte.php');\n\n$spte \\= new spte();\n\n$spte\\-&gt;format($template, array());\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/simple-php-template-engine/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here is an example using SPTE to create a simple web page.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\ninclude\\_once('spte.php');\n\n$spte \\= new spte();\n\n$template \\= '\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n\n&lt;title&gt;Demo: Simple PHP Template Engine&lt;/title&gt;\n\n&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;@heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n\n  @hello-world Today is @date!&lt;br/&gt;\n\n  Check out the source code to notice difference on the next lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\n  !fourth-line&lt;br/&gt;\n\n  @fifth-line&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n';\n\nprint $spte\\-&gt;format($template, array(\n\n  '@heading' \\=\\&gt; 'SPTE',\n\n  '@hello-world' \\=\\&gt; 'Hello World!',\n\n  '@date' \\=\\&gt; date('l'),\n\n  '!fourth-line' \\=\\&gt; 'This line is unconverted &quot;',\n\n  '@fifth-line' \\=\\&gt; 'This line is converted &quot;'\n\n));\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see we have included SPTE at the first lines and then created:</p>\n<pre><code>$template \\= '\n\n@example\n\n!example\n\n';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which has all our HTML code. In that variable we are using the following variable spaces:</p>\n<pre><code>@example \\- which converts special characters to HTML entities.\n\n!example \\- which just gives plain output from PHP.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The difference between the two can be seen at the <a href=\"https://www.lennu.net/demo/spte/\">demo page</a> where you need to check out the souce code of lines four and five.</p>\n<p>At the end we are using function of SPTE to format out HTML and give variable spaces the values we have assigned.</p>\n<pre><code>print $spte\\-&gt;format($template, array(\n\n  '@example' \\=\\&gt; '[\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)',\n\n  '!example' \\=\\&gt; 'example!'\n\n));\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can freely use SPTE for anything you want.

The answer is Swiper.</p>\n<p>jQuery Mobile Slider is something a lot of new mobile sites use these days to create horizontal sliding effects on their web pages. I have went through all of them to find the best one for my purposes. You can actually use even if you don’t have jQuery but you can surely use it as a plugin. This is the second post in my web slider post series and on this post I’m going to show you an very simple example of mobile optimized and well running slider.</p>\n<p>The JavaScript plugin I’m using is called Swiper, and I think a lot of websites use it these days even though they don’t mention it. It is simply great and it is being continuesly developed. It is used by Adobe, BMW, Disney etc. on their mobile websites, so it has quite good customer base. The greatest thing of course is that it’s completely free.</p>\n<p>In a mobile slider, I think, we are looking for some specially touch based logic. Like <strong>continuous sliding</strong> after you release your finger from the screen, or in another words <strong>free rolling slider</strong>. Swiper can manage to do that and it does it amazingly well. It is at its best on iPhones, but don’t choke it too much with events, on that side it has a lot to work on. I have found it to work on every machine and browser, so it is has great coding.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/JsfzTlTdGN-1464.avif 1464w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/JsfzTlTdGN-1464.webp 1464w\"><img alt=\"Swiper\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/JsfzTlTdGN-1464.jpeg\" width=\"1464\" height=\"327\"></picture></p>\n<p>Swiper is especially made for mobile browsers and has free rolling option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swiper-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Swiper Example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/jquery-mobile-slider-example-with-swiper/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have gathered here all the materials you need to create your own Swiper. First there is the HTML. The library includes are already in the template so you just need to download the plugin and place the dist folder to the same folder as you have your HTML file. You can download Swiper at <a href=\"https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/archive/v3.0.7.zip\">https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/archive/v3.0.7.zip</a>.</p>\n<p>Remember you don’t actually have to use jQuery but there is jQuery and native plugins on the zip file. In this example we wont be using jQuery because we don’t need it.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang\\=&quot;en&quot;\\&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n\n&lt;title&gt;Demo: jQuery Mobile Slider Example with Swiper&lt;/title&gt;\n\n&lt;link rel\\=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href\\=&quot;dist/css/swiper.min.css&quot;\\&gt;\n\n&lt;meta name\\=&quot;viewport&quot; content\\=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;\\&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n\n.swiper-container { width: 95%; height: 300px; }\n\n.swiper-slide { width: 32%; background: red; text-align: center; padding-top: 50%; font-size: 24px; }\n\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Add Swiper slides here! --&gt;\n\n&lt;script src\\=&quot;dist/js/swiper.min.js&quot; type\\=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\\&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Add the initialization JavaScript code here! --&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are two places we need to fill in. There first one is the Swiper slides. Add these silder, or any slides you want into the HTML. Just follow the syntax.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-container&quot;\\&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-wrapper&quot;\\&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;To&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;All&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;The&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;Readers&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;!!&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;Lennu.net&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class\\=&quot;swiper-slide&quot;\\&gt;Swiper&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>At the end we only need to initialize Swiper with our favourite options. I like to use free rolling and looping on my example, but you can find a ton of options from <a href=\"http://www.idangero.us/swiper/api/\">Swiper API</a>. Add this JavaScript to your HTML page.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n\n  var swiper \\= new Swiper('.swiper-container', { // HTML element selector\n\n    slidesPerView: 'auto', // How many slides do we want per view? You can specify a number\n\n    spaceBetween: 10, // Space between the slides\n\n    freeMode: true, // Free rolling slider\n\n    loop: true, // Swiper loops your slides, and there is no ending point\n\n    loopedSlides: 8 // Safe option which needs to be set if you use slidesPerView: 'auto'\n\n  });\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have now created ourselves a multi device and multi browser working mobile optimized jQuery Slider! This tutorial has been about how create a very basic slider. There are a lot of work after this to place this to real application or website and style it very well. But with this template you have a very good starting point.</p>\n<p>Swiper is truly the best choice at the moment when building a new mobile website or mobile app with HTML5, if you need a well working slider. Please try it, use it, debug it and check out its website at <a href=\"http://www.idangero.us/swiper/\">http://www.idangero.us/swiper/</a>.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Responsive jQuery Slider is something I have worked with for some time now. I have found some good plugins to create this and Owl Carousel is one of those jQuery plugins. Basically it is a plugin you need to create a slideshow to your website. This carousel is especially developed having responsive design in mind. Owl Carousel has two version but I recommend you all use the second version which is basically a rewrite of the first and has everything running smoother.</p>\n<p>Owl Carousel has plenty of modes and options to choose from but I’ve the plugin to be best at simple three images side by side image slider type of slideshow. The transitions are super smooth and the workflow is really simple. Owl Carousel doesn’t have free rolling so it is not very good when developing large sliders for mobile devices, but for small slideshows it works very well. The responsive options are very easily created.</p>\n<p>I have tested it on most of the major mobile devices and it works on all of them very nicely. And of course modern desktop browsers are supported too.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/pTlZim72LD-746.avif 746w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/pTlZim72LD-746.webp 746w\"><img alt=\"Owl Carousel\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/pTlZim72LD-746.jpeg\" width=\"746\" height=\"153\"></picture></p>\n<p>With Owl Carousel you can make many kinds of slideshows, especially responsive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"owl-carousel-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Owl Carousel Example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/responsive-jquery-slider-example-with-owl-carousel/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In order to initialize Owl Carousel, we need to include some files to our HTML code. There are JavaScript and CSS file to be included. As this is a jQuery plugin make sure you include jQuery before Owl Carousel. If you don’t, Owl Carousel can’t find jQuery and you will end up with JavaScript errors.</p>\n<p>Here is the HTML template we will be needing for this example. I also added some styling to make the example more clear.</p>\n<p>You can download Owl Carousel assets at <a href=\"http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/download/owl.carousel.zip\">http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/download/owl.carousel.zip</a>. Make sure to unzip them to the same location you have your web page on.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang\\=&quot;en&quot;\\&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n\n&lt;title&gt;Demo: Responsive jQuery Slider Example with Owl Carousel&lt;/title&gt;\n\n&lt;link rel\\=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href\\=&quot;assets/owl.carousel.css&quot;\\&gt;\n\n&lt;meta name\\=&quot;viewport&quot; content\\=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;\\&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n\n.owl-carousel { max-width: 900px; min-height: 300px; overflow: hidden; }\n\n.owl-item { float: left; background: red; text-align:center; height: 100px; }\n\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Add Owl Carousel items here! --&gt;\n\n&lt;script src\\=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js&quot; type\\=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\\&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script src\\=&quot;owl.carousel.min.js&quot; type\\=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\\&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Add the initialization JavaScript code here! --&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to add Owl Carousel HTML and its items to create our slideshow.<br>\nAdd the following HTML to the template.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class\\=&quot;owl-carousel&quot;\\&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class\\=&quot;item&quot;\\&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class\\=&quot;item&quot;\\&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class\\=&quot;item&quot;\\&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class\\=&quot;item&quot;\\&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class\\=&quot;item&quot;\\&gt;5&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have the basic layout done, now we need to initialize it with some JavaScript code. There is a “responsive” section on the JavaScript, that creates the breakpoints where slide item count is changed. If you resize your browser, you can see that Owl Carousel changes its behaviour depending on the size of the window. Now add the following initialization script to the template and we are done.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script type\\=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\\&gt;\n\n$('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ // .owl-carousel is the element selector\n\n  margin: 10, // gives space between carousel items\n\n  stagePadding: 20, // shows a bit of the next item, which is still not visible\n\n  responsive:{ // responsive behaviour\n\n    0:{\n\n      items:1\n\n    },\n\n    768:{ // for example at 768 screen width, owl carousel will only show two items\n\n      items:2\n\n    },\n\n    970:{\n\n      items:3\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n})\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats it! You can find a lot more about Owl Carousel from its own <a href=\"http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/\">website</a> there are many demos and all the options you can use with it.  This was only a little tutorial into the subject. Next I will be covering the mobile optimized slider called <a href=\"http://www.lennu.net/jquery-mobile-slider-example-with-swiper/\">Swiper</a> which is really good at doing free rolling slideshows.</p>\n",

All of them have their own standards and ways to implement their cloud. But they all have one thing in common. All of the cloud service providers basically want your app to be ran from their cloud, and they all have an automatic system to deploy your app into their cloud. I don’t know if this is already common knowledge out there, but I think there is a huge opportunity for a completely new market to be born.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloud-broker-service\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cloud Broker Service <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/cloud-brokers-to-marketize-the-cloud/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Cloud Service Broker is still a concept (in my opinion) and it means that a third party is set to be between the customer and the cloud service provider. This is because dealing with all the specifications can be timeconsuming and kinda hassle if you just want to release your great new application or website to the internet.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/rvdgyhgPfL-300.avif 300w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/rvdgyhgPfL-300.webp 300w\"><img alt=\"House\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/rvdgyhgPfL-300.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></picture></p>\n<p>Cloud Brokering is a bit different than house brokering.</p>\n<p>Let’s say Bob wants to buy a house. He searches a bit and finds a great new home. Bob then contacts the housing broker (real estate agent) and buys the house. The great part is that the seller doesn’t need to communicate with the buyer, he or she can outsource the work to the broker.</p>\n<p>Cloud brokering is a bit different. In cloud broker service the customer goes directly to the broker and tells his or hers requirements for the cloud. Cloud broker finds the right cloud for him or her and deploys the application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-service\" tabindex=\"-1\">Advanced Service <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/cloud-brokers-to-marketize-the-cloud/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is really what gave the inspiration to write this post. Sure there are consultants doing all kind of recommendations for certain clouds and deploying services.</p>\n<p>But what if there would be a web application which would automate all of this. I can really see this happening since all the major cloud service providers have APIs for their service.</p>\n<p>Bob has just finished his great new app. He goes to a Cloud Broker website, signs up and chooses some variants for the cloud he would be needing. Bob then uploads his app to the web application which deploys it into the cheapest and the best matching cloud depending on Bobs choices. Bob has just deployed his app to the cloud. He doesn’t need to know where his app is, he just have to pay to the cloud broker for the service.</p>\n<p>Bob wakes up the next day and checks his emails. Cloud Broker had found better choice at night and had deployed Bobs app into this cloud. Bob saved money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"techical-details\" tabindex=\"-1\">Techical Details <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/cloud-brokers-to-marketize-the-cloud/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The main technical tool required for this is the new container technology where platforms like <a href=\"http://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> will play big part in the deployance of the web. Cloud Broker web application can create a container where the deployed application rests. This container can then be transferred and moved to where ever Cloud Broker finds the most suitable.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/SqGn4rn4Bo-640.avif 640w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/SqGn4rn4Bo-640.webp 640w\"><img alt=\"Cloud Containers\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/SqGn4rn4Bo-640.jpeg\" width=\"640\" height=\"423\"></picture></p>\n<p>Even at the middle of the night, your application could be moved into a better, more powerful or cheaper cloud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloud-market\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cloud Market <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/cloud-brokers-to-marketize-the-cloud/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What this all means is that the web application which matches customers requirements and chooses the best and the cheapest option can truly marketize the cloud. The service providers would have to compete against each other and not just rule by having best marketing program.</p>\n<p>Cloud computing is becoming the most used processing power there is.

			"title": "jQuery Lazy Loading Images with Simple Example",
			"content_html": "<p>This week I stumbled upon a great mystery of Lazy Loading. I have seen this effect on multiple websites but never an example of how to do it.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that when you have many images on a website, they tend to take a lot of time to load when user connects to your website. With lazy load we can prevent the loading of these images until user should see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lazy-loading\" tabindex=\"-1\">Lazy Loading <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/jquery-lazy-loading-images-simple-example/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are variety of plugins and addons made to do this but I found them quite complicated and maybe too little of a function to come from a separate plugin. So why not do it ourselves if we could find a direction to the right path? Lazy loading can sound big project but it really isn’t, and really doesn’t need a plugin to do the work for you.</p>\n<p>So I searched and searched, and finally found this great site: <a href=\"http://upshots.org/javascript/jquery-test-if-element-is-in-viewport-visible-on-screen\">http://upshots.org/javascript/jquery-test-if-element-is-in-viewport-visible-on-screen</a>. This was exactly what I needed and credits goes to them. This is infact a jQuery plugin but the way it is presented gives a great value for using it in your own production.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Example <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/jquery-lazy-loading-images-simple-example/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here’s the JavaScript code where is the isOnScreen function, which I linked earlier. It basically searches for the elements visibility on viewport or in other words does the use see the element.</p>\n<p>I have also made function called lazyload, which goes through all lazyload classed elements on the page and shows them by setting data-src to the elements src. By doing this the browser knows to load the received source data and that way shows the image to the user. I have attached also a event listener to scrolling so that when user scrolls the function is loaded.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script type\\=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\\&gt;\n\nwindow.onload \\= function() {\n\n  $.fn.isOnScreen \\= function(){\n\n    var win \\= $(window)\n\n    var viewport \\= {\n\n      top : win.scrollTop(),\n\n      left : win.scrollLeft()\n\n    }\n\n    viewport.right \\= viewport.left + win.width()\n\n    viewport.bottom \\= viewport.top + win.height()\n\n    var bounds \\= this.offset()\n\n    bounds.right \\= bounds.left + this.outerWidth()\n\n    bounds.bottom \\= bounds.top + this.outerHeight()\n\n    return (!(viewport.right &lt; bounds.left || viewport.left \\&gt; bounds.right || viewport.bottom &lt; bounds.top || viewport.top \\&gt; bounds.bottom))\n\n  }\n\n  function lazyload() {\n\n    $('.lazyload').each(function() {\n\n      var element \\= $(this)\n\n      if (element.isOnScreen()) {\n\n        element.attr('src', element.data('src'))\n\n        element.removeClass('lazyload')\n\n      }\n\n    })\n\n  }\n\n  lazyload()\n\n  $(window).scroll(function() {\n\n    lazyload()\n\n  })\n\n}\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The elements which you want to lazy load, in this case the images, need to have <strong>lazyload class</strong> attached into their HTML code. Also remember to <strong>insert the original image src to data-src</strong> attribute.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;img class\\=&quot;lazyload&quot; data\\-src\\=&quot;golden-star.png&quot; alt\\=&quot;Golden Star&quot; /\\&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can attach that JavaScript into your webpage where you have jQuery enabled and the images configured properly, and it should work okay for you. Remember in this example we only have scrolling event which might not always be enough.</p>\n<p>This example is simple and powerful and please study the JavaScript out to learn more of it. Here is finally some images which should give you idea how lazy loading really should work. I have attached lazy loading on this page by using the code that is in the example. If you go quicly through them you will see that they appear while browsing. Or if you can set Chrome browser to low internet connection speed, then you will surely see the effect. Or just take a look at your developer tools and see the images loading while scrolling down on the network tab.</p>\n<p>That was it! I hope you enjoyed the example. Please post a comment if you have something in mind about this!</p>\n",

This widely spread function has come across at some point for us all. Usually at the beginning of learning how to program, we get the need to know how to processing of our finely tuned software. Most of the times this due to programming something in a funny way or just debugging and finding out what is going on.</p>\n<p>Sleep function is part of every modern and not so modern programming language. It is used on many tasks but usually the main task of it is to wait something to happen. It usually works by suspending the execution of currently processing thread, but I think there are some solutions which just causes the program to “wait” until the time specified in the Sleep Function has passed.</p>\n<p>The use cases where you have to use sleep function are quite minimal. I can only figure out one. If you have a job running on multiple web servers and the job updates on a regular basis. You apply a sleep function to the process and update them on a different interval so that at least one server has the information available all the time. Do you have any good examples of the sleep function?</p>\n<h2 id=\"sleep-function-examples\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sleep Function Examples <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/sleep-function-examples-popular-programming-languages/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here I have gathered example code for the most used programming languages. If you think something is missing from the list, please post a comment and let me know.</p>\n<p>Remember using programming languages sleep function is usually not the best way to do waiting. In my opinion you should always use function callbacks  which occur after something has happened and not sleep the program until it has.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abap\" tabindex=\"-1\">ABAP <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/sleep-function-examples-popular-programming-languages/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Releases the work process to the listener and does an implicit database commit.</p>\n<pre><code>WAIT UP TO 10 SECONDS.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does not release the process and does not do an implicit database commit.</p>\n<pre><code>CALL FUNCTION 'ENQUE\\_SLEEP'\n\n  EXPORTING\n\n  seconds  \\= 10.\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"assembly\" tabindex=\"-1\">Assembly <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/sleep-function-examples-popular-programming-languages/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There ain’t no actual Assembly sleep function.

Windows is at it’s version of 8, Mac which operating system goes by the name of OS X is at its’ tenth version and Linux has a lot of different variations but the most used distribution is Ubuntu which is at version 14.10.</p>\n<p>This post based on my personal opinions of these operating systems and should be read that way. I have used Windows, Mac and Linux for considerably good time. I have based my thoughts on these moments and here I will give you a little tour of their strengths and weaknesses as Windows, Mac and Linux are ultimately the choices you have as a operting system. The idea for this post came at me when I was offered a brand new MacBook Pro at my workplace.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windows-mac-and-linux-comparison\" tabindex=\"-1\">Windows, Mac and Linux comparison <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/window-mac-linux/windows-mac-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As I said I have used Windows, Mac and Linux for a good time to know them well. Most of my time with computers I have spent with Windows. I have always had it home where I use it daily for media and gaming. I started to use Linux while I was at high school and where I got to install a web server for the first time. From that point I have used Linux on a weekly basis for operating my websites and did some cool project where I used Linux as a back end. I have also used its’ desktop utilities for many years on my laptop. Mac I haven’t used as much a the other two. I had a MacBook couple of years ago which worked very well and I used while studying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"windows\" tabindex=\"-1\">Windows <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/window-mac-linux/windows-mac-linux/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Windows has always been my favourite operating system from the grand group of Windows, Mac and Linux. The easiness of it is the greatest thing, but as far as my knowledge has risen on Windows, you can do also the most advanced things with it.</p>\n<p>It is at its’ best when you just need a operating system which has great web browsing experience, gaming and working with a lot of files. Web browsers on Windows works great and the user interface of them combined to Windows is usually a very smooth experience.</p>\n<p>Windows is the most used and most supported operating system of Windows, Mac and Linux. Everything you need works on it and especially if you like gaming, you don’t have to fear that something wouldn’t work. The great hardware support on Windows is really effective matter, as most of the graphic cards are generally made especially for Windows.</p>\n<p>The user interface of Windows is by far the best of Windows, Mac and Linux. The ease of usage in all areas of Windows are the well cared to make the process as good as it can get. The combination of windows in Windows and your physical mouse can get anything done on fast pace. The file management is the grand jewel of Windows because it is brilliantly simple and you can navigate through them and find anything you need in no time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mac\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mac <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/window-mac-linux/windows-mac-linux/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Operating system of Mac is OS X, which is probably most modern system of Windows, Mac and Linux. It is very application based and has some of the best features there can be. The best thing about Mac is the grand ease of usage for people with very little computer skills. OS X guides you through everything and shows you the way if you are lost. So it is a safe choice for new people entering the world of computers.</p>\n<p>OS X is the second most used operating system used in desktop and laptop computer behind Windows. There are some things you can’t do with a Mac but usually those things that you can do are very well catered especially for Mac. The installation process of new applications is very straight forward compared to Windows. The user interface is very beautiful and gives a lot of inspiration to enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>As OS X is very similar to Linux deep down, it has a lot of its’ good sides, for example the command line interface. But if you are very experienced computer user and have been playing around with Windows and Linux for you entire life jumping into Mac can be a bit of a hassle. The file management is a mess and doesn’t feel like a good tool while using it. I can’t really tell what is the matter with it, but compared to Windows the file and window management feels very clumsy and complicated.</p>\n<p>One bad thing that bugs me every time I intend to start using Mac is the pressure of registering yourself an account to Apple services. OS X is the only platform that doesn’t give you the full properties of the operating system, if you are not registered to Apple.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linux\" tabindex=\"-1\">Linux <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/window-mac-linux/windows-mac-linux/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Linux has been along very long time and mostly today it is used as a base for servers and phones because of its’ great features of customization. You can do anything with Linux. I have been using for many years Ubuntu Linux distribution on a server and on my laptop. Many think that using Linux on a laptop is weird and very hard. Actually <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> has been made to be very easy even for the most inexperienced users. The best part of Linux is application installation system which in Ubuntu is called apt-get. It is a command line based application, and I call it the best package manager computer can have.</p>\n<p>If I were to start using one of Windows, Mac and Linux as a beginner I would be happy if someone gave me direction towards Linux systems. The moment you start using command line and get to know it gives you great power and helps you do daily tasks with such ease that cannot be found from other operating systems. For example updating the operating system and its’ application is done by two little commands: update and upgrade.</p>\n<p>The graphical user interface of Linux is usually the worst of Windows, Mac and Linux. There just ain’t such resources in the Linux development community to create as good user interface as commercialized Windows and Mac has. You can do pretty much anything you want as in other operating systems, but most of the functions feel a bit unfinished.</p>\n<p>So why would you choose Linux from the group of Windows, Mac and Linux? Well one thing that amazes me on a regular basis is that people doesn’t care that it is free. But it certainly is. You can download and install Linux to your computer any day. All the updates are free and you will have hard time looking for a Linux software that ain’t free. Linux is also the root system and can be customized to what ever you want. There are all the same things that are in Macs but lacks also the same things as Mac do from Windows. It is the best operating system out of Windows, Mac and Linux for people who want to know how to do tasks and not just do them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/window-mac-linux/windows-mac-linux/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Windows is the best operating system of the three, if you are looking for solid and very well supported operating system. The vast time spent to make the user interface as good as it is, is very impressive. Everything works and you can do anything you want with it.</p>\n<p>Mac is made to endure the user. If you want a cookie cutter system which does what you tell it to do, OS X does that the best of Windows, Mac and Linux. The experience will surely be the best and the most beautiful and you will become good friends with the operating system. There are some flaws like pressure for registering the system with Apple, and the lack of support for certain areas. The system can be customized but it is not intended. Personally I don’t like it at all because it closes you into its’ borders.</p>\n<p>Linux is the jack of all trades if you get to know it. The major thing about it the customization and how much you can do it. Linux can be the best operating system if you learn it well, but for even the most inexperienced users can found pure joy because nowadays Linux can also be the operating system for the first timers.</p>\n<p>Of Windows, Mac and Linux, Windows and Linux have been the greatest. Windows works always and is a speedy solution. Linux gives me abilities that Windows can’t achieve in a good way, and the great feeling of customization. Mac doesn’t do me anything since, its’ operating system OS X tries to bind me into it and make me forget everything else about computers.</p>\n<p>If you have a view which of the grand three is the best, let me know! Post a comment and share your thoughts.</p>\n",

In celebration of this I have concluded a post which contains examples of great CSS Shadow effects and how to use them.</p>\n<p>There are thousands of usage points with filters and one of the best is CSS Shadow. In order to achieve the effects of shadows in web design we may use text shadow, drop shadow or box shadow. The best case is if you can make a plain image and apply CSS Shadow to that and not create the picture with the shadow. This creates amazing effects on differently scaled and sized devices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"css-shadow-examples\" tabindex=\"-1\">CSS Shadow Examples <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/css-shadow/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have gathered some great examples of the usage of CSS Shadow in a form of Text Shadow, Drop Shadow and Box Shadow. These all create the fantastic effects which we are looking for.</p>\n<p>I have commented a description of the attributes and how tou use the styling. By using CSS Shadow you enter yourself into the new world of web design. If you have questions or would like get a good example of some different CSS Shadow on this page, please make a comment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"text-shadow\" tabindex=\"-1\">Text Shadow <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/css-shadow/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Text Shadow Example</p>\n<pre><code>text-shadow: 1px 2px 4px #000; // horizontal vertical blur color\n</code></pre>\n<p>Text Shadow is a CSS Shadow which gives the text a proper shadow effect. This does not work on IE9 but IE10 does support it. Here is an example.</p>\n<p>Multiple Text Shadow Example</p>\n<pre><code>text-shadow: 2px 1px 2px #000, 0px 0px 1px #000; //horizontal vertical blur color\n</code></pre>\n<p>Multiple shadows are created by applying multiple rules into the CSS line. This can give the text a more 3D feeling or a very nice color effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drop-shadow\" tabindex=\"-1\">Drop Shadow <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/css-shadow/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With drop shadow you can achieve great effects like taking a logo or a symbol out of a background and bringing it to life.  Drop shadows can be done by a special filter. Box shadow can be a backup for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg589484%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">IE9</a> users but the truly great drop shadows for modern browsers are done by using the filter tag. This filter tag will create an amazing drop shadow which will follow all the lines of the targeted element.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/uf3K3Sd-tC-300.avif 300w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/uf3K3Sd-tC-300.webp 300w\"><img alt=\"Golden Star\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/uf3K3Sd-tC-300.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></picture></p>\n<pre><code>-webkit-filter: drop-shadow(12px 12px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5));\n\nfilter: drop-shadow(12px 12px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)); // horizontal vertical blur color\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>If you are using Firefox and don’t see the CSS Shadow effect</strong>, then you are using an outdated version. Because on the version 35.0 Firefox added the support for drop shadow filter. An outdated version of Firefox drop shadow is created by using filter which makes an SVG Shadow outlining the target.</p>\n<pre><code>filter: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;utf8,&lt;svg height=\\\\'0\\\\' xmlns=\\\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\\\'&gt;&lt;filter id=\\\\'drop-shadow\\\\'&gt;&lt;feGaussianBlur in=\\\\'SourceAlpha\\\\' stdDeviation=\\\\'4\\\\'/&gt;&lt;feOffset dx=\\\\'12\\\\' dy=\\\\'12\\\\' result=\\\\'offsetblur\\\\'/&gt;&lt;feFlood flood-color=\\\\'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\\\\'/&gt;&lt;feComposite in2=\\\\'offsetblur\\\\' operator=\\\\'in\\\\'/&gt;&lt;feMerge&gt;&lt;feMergeNode/&gt;&lt;feMergeNode in=\\\\'SourceGraphic\\\\'/&gt;&lt;/feMerge&gt;&lt;/filter&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;#drop-shadow&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This was a very good way to create drop shadows but since Firefox now also supports filters by default, it is a bit unnecessary. Please update your browser in order to enable the latest technologies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"box-shadow\" tabindex=\"-1\">Box Shadow <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/css-shadow/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With box shadow you can create boxy styled CSS Shadow. So it is perfect for rectangle like object, and not so good for rounded or oddly shaped objects. But it also supports more than one shadows, so you can create amazing effects like this glowy call to action button. This is created with two different shadows separated by a comma in CSS code.</p>\n<p>Call to action</p>\n<pre><code>box-shadow: 0 0 5px #108000, 0 0 8px #109600; // horizontal vertiucal blur color\n</code></pre>\n",

It is WordPress. There are tens of very good blogging platforms out there, but there just aint as good as WordPress. My last blogging platform here on Lennu.net was Octopress, and it served me very well for last few years. It was a new technology when it was released and I was excited about it. But after using WordPress on some other websites, I knew that I had to change. There just are not as simple tool as WordPress and that makes it the best blogging platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-wordpress-the-best-blogging-platform\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why is WordPress the best blogging platform? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/best-blogging-platform-is-wordpress/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are multiple reasons, but the reason number one is the fact that it is the simplest tool for blogging with thousands of features. The catch here is that those features are optional. Everyone will want to use some of these great features at some point. Why would you choose any other blogging framework as there might be a point where you want to do something special. In WordPress almost everything has been done and put into a plugin. Just install them and you are good to go. That is simple.</p>\n<p>If you want to write a new blog post. Click on Add New and write it, no hassle. Want to add some images into the post? Click Add Media and upload the picture, thats it. The ease of use in the interface of WordPress Admin has been done with great passion. There are nothing too much or too little.</p>\n<p>Did I mention the templates? There are hundreds of free magnificent templates for you to grab and have a great new look and feel on your blog.</p>\n<p>The comments on posts are easily managed and you can avoid spam by filtering everything by your command. Or you can use Disqus to have third party commenting platform. How ever you want to achieve the thing you want to do in WordPress, the main point is that probably there is a solution already.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a great blogging platform, then WordPress it is. It is the best. The settings are easy to set and you shouldn’t have any think through moments with them. Just make the best blogging platform do what you want. Add a new post and write anything you want. Need a new feature like contact form? Install it from the plugins section.</p>\n<p>I have been trying to find the best blogging platform since 2006, and I have truly found it. It is at the same time the easiest to use and the most feature rich blogging platform there is. And that makes WordPress the best blogging platform and if you disagree, please leave a comment.</p>\n<p>You can have a free WordPress blogging platform at <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>. And if you need any more details of the best blogging platform, please look at <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a>, which maintains the project.</p>\n",

Or just want to test some issues multiple times between development phases? I have tried some testing tools including the widely used Selenium. These tools tend to be quite heavy and hard to start doing the actual testing.</p>\n<p>Now there is a new guy in the room which in my opinion offers a quite new experience. Dalek.js provides simple and very fast way to do automated web testing which scales from very small projects to large ones. It supports all the major browsers and can script them, take screenshots and create reports about the tests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"automated-web-testing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Automated web testing <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/web-testing-tutorial-using-dalekjs/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Web testing is something you would do to ensure everything is working correctly in a website. For example if you are developing a new website and you are still doing the development, you may want to make sure everything keeps working while doing changes to the source code. Or maybe you would want to test if your website is cross browser compatible?</p>\n<p>All of these can be quite time consuming to do if you start doing them by hand. And even if you would finish them fast there are always a chance that you can make human mistakes during the testing. What if you want to do the same tests later?</p>\n<p>For all of these cases there have been made software to help testing the web. One of the latest to enter this area is <a href=\"http://dalekjs.com/\">DalekJS</a> which comes with a powerful feature of beign very easy to deploy and write and run the tests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dalek-js-installation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dalek.js installation <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/web-testing-tutorial-using-dalekjs/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We need to install node.js and npm in order to install Dalek.js.</p>\n<h4 id=\"node-js\" tabindex=\"-1\">node.js <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/web-testing-tutorial-using-dalekjs/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>If you are using Ubuntu or similar modern Linux you can fetch it with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nodejs\nsudo apt-get install npm\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your Linux can’t find the packages you can compile them yourself by downloading the source from: <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/download/\">http://nodejs.org/download/</a>.</p>\n<p>From the same location you can also download the Windows installer.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dalek-js\" tabindex=\"-1\">dalek.js <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/web-testing-tutorial-using-dalekjs/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Once we have installed node.js we can fetch dalek.js from npm repository.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install dalek-cli -g\nnpm install dalekjs --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats it!

It offers simple usage syntax and has all the options I need. It’s not so great as Deluge when it comes to console UI. Transmission is the only command-line torrent client for Ubuntu which I have found that has very large option list for working as a service. For example you can set it to follow some directory where you just drop .torrent-files and it automaticly loads them from there. My choice is Transmission.</p>\n<p>You can install it using <code>sudo apt-get install transmission</code> and service <code>sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon</code></p>\n<p>More information: <a href=\"http://www.transmissionbt.com/\">Transmission</a></p>\n",

Despite the fact that mr. Stallman in his speech made sure everybody now knows who really did all the hard work and why the operating system should be known as GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux.</p>\n<h3 id=\"speech-number-one\" tabindex=\"-1\">Speech number one <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/richard-stallman-visited-our-school/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The first speech was more about the history of GNU operating system and why every human soul should respect the original values of the project. The speech started explaining what Free Software movement is and how it is used. It was very good knowledge and I think many in the audience agreed with the theories and gave some support for them.</p>\n<p>He also explained with examples why free software should be all around us. For example if I heard corrent Richard Stallman does not have a portable telephone because that machine can be traced and is not open. When the speech went on, it came more and more clear that Richard had been offended in alot of ways by alot of people breaking the original idea behind GNU operating system. I think in the speech he said some bad things first about Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon and after all this he started the usual rant against Linus Torvalds who is the number one devil ruining GNU.</p>\n<p>At the end of his speech he wore a cloak and a hat and blessed the audience with the style of church Emacs. That was kinda funny and everybody laughed alot so it ended well!</p>\n<h3 id=\"speech-number-two\" tabindex=\"-1\">Speech number two <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/richard-stallman-visited-our-school/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>On the second speech Richard Stallman talked a little bit the same of GNU and trash talk about certain big companies.</p>\n<p>But he also made some comments about programming. He talked about some really good tricks in debugging and how you should use break points to narrow down the error in the software. He also gave some good tips if you’d like to join the free software movement and help it’s cause by doing some actual coding.</p>\n<p>On his second speech he gave alot of time for questions from the audience and one man made a huge mistake by trying to overtalk him in free software arguments. You should know better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"summary\" tabindex=\"-1\">Summary <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/richard-stallman-visited-our-school/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>His speeches had some truly amazing points about free software and how world should be. But I think they are alot drawn away from reality. But after all it is a movement which tries to get things better in a long run which he reminded us that real software development has existed only 20-30 years.</p>\n<p>I personally didn’t like his trash talk about big companies and mr. Torvalds but maybe someone has to say these things out loud.</p>\n<p>He is a great public speaker and has very important things to say but maybe some things could be said in another way. But anyway, he gave two great speeches about his work in the development of GNU/Linux and you should respect atleat some of his views if you use something which have risen from his GNU operating system project. Thanks mr. Stallman!</p>\n<p>Btw. I also gave a speech on the event after Richard Stallman but I guess that is not so interesting. (smiley)</p>\n",

On this post I will show you example for Templates, Parameterized Classes and Defined Types. All examples were made on Ubuntu 12.04 and you can find all the rest of the example articles from the archive section of this website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"templates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Templates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-templates-and-paremeterized-classes-and-defined-types/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Template are way to make different choices on different Puppet clients. For example not all of your clients operating systems are always the same so there might be some differences on them. And especially on the hardware site where most of the computers usually differ somehow from each other.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple example for getting the operating system out from your client. I’ll make a module templatetesti and define there a class which will make file which contains our template. The template itself contains some ruby code and is the next code section after the class.</p>\n<pre><code>class templatetesti {\n        file {'/tmp/templatetesti':\n                ensure=&gt;file,\n                content=&gt;template('templatetesti/templatetesti.erb'),\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;%= @operatingsystem %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"parameterized-classes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Parameterized Classes <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-templates-and-paremeterized-classes-and-defined-types/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>These classes are like any other programming language classes. You can give them parameters to get some specific result. Remember that you can’t use include with these classes. The right way is just to <code>puppet apply testclass.pp</code>. First create a module and then the parameter class.</p>\n<pre><code>class testpara ($value1) {\n        notify {&quot;${value1}&quot;:}\n        package {&quot;${value1}&quot;:\n                provider=&gt;apt,\n                ensure=&gt;installed,\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>class {'testpara':\n        value1=&gt;'apache2',\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"defined-types\" tabindex=\"-1\">Defined Types <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-templates-and-paremeterized-classes-and-defined-types/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With defined types you can give definitions to certain resources. This is a straight copy from Puppets documentation.</p>\n<pre><code>define planfile ($user = $title, $content) {\n\tfile {&quot;/home/${user}/.plan&quot;:\n\t\tensure  =&gt; file,\n\t\tcontent =&gt; $content,\n\t\tmode    =&gt; 0644,\n\t\towner   =&gt; $user,\n\t\trequire =&gt; User[$user],\n\t\t}\n\t}\n \nuser {'nick':\n\tensure     =&gt; present,\n\tmanagehome =&gt; true,\n\tuid        =&gt; 517,\n}\nplanfile {'nick':\n\tcontent =&gt; &quot;Working on new Learning Puppet chapters.

You need to have your wlan config file in your module files section.</p>\n<pre><code>class changewlanpassword {\n        file { &quot;/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/lennu.net&quot;:\n                source =&gt; 'puppet:///modules/changewlanpassword/lennu.net',\n                owner =&gt; root,\n        }\n \n        service { 'network-manager':\n                ensure =&gt; running,\n                subscribe =&gt; File['/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/lennu.net'],\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

You have to use Puppet’s own resource ordering Metaparameters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"metaparameters\" tabindex=\"-1\">Metaparameters <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-ordering-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Puppet has four different metaparameters you can use to order the running case. <code>before</code>, <code>require</code> and <code>subscribe</code>. Here are the examples for all of them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"before\" tabindex=\"-1\">before <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-ordering-examples/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>before lists resources that depends on it, for example right now Notify required Package to be ran.</p>\n<pre><code>package { 'apache2':\n        provider=&gt;'apt',\n        ensure=&gt;'installed',\n\tbefore=&gt;Notify['Apache2 is installed.'],\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is installed.':\n}\n \nservice { 'apache2':\n        ensure=&gt;'running'\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is running.':\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"require\" tabindex=\"-1\">require <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-ordering-examples/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>require is as it says a requirement, now we can put Package under Notify since we need Package to be ran in order to send the notify.</p>\n<pre><code>package { 'apache2':\n        provider=&gt;'apt',\n        ensure=&gt;'installed',\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is installed.':\n\trequire=&gt;Package['apache2']\n}\n \nservice { 'apache2':\n        ensure=&gt;'running'\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is running.':\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"subscribe\" tabindex=\"-1\">subscribe <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-ordering-examples/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>subscribe make a resource subscribe to another resource. This means that everytime Puppet makes some actual changes to the subscribed resource it will trigger also the subscriber to do changes. On this example every time /tmp/apache -file contents change and we run this file there will be a trigger to refresh apache2 service.</p>\n<pre><code>file {'/tmp/apache':\n        ensure=&gt;file,\n        content=&gt;'Subscribe testing!'\n}\n \npackage { 'apache2':\n        provider=&gt;'apt',\n        ensure=&gt;'installed',\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is installed.':\n}\n \nservice { 'apache2':\n        ensure=&gt;'running',\n        subscribe=&gt;File['/tmp/apache'],\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is running.':\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"chaining\" tabindex=\"-1\">Chaining <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-ordering-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Chaining is setting resources in the ordering you’d like them to be. <code>-&gt; or &lt;-</code> goes for ordering and <code>~&gt; or &lt;~</code> goes for subscribing. You should always think the arrows like time. Right going arrow means the target is synced after the shooter. In this example I have made Notifications to be ran on the wrong time just to show the effectiveness.</p>\n<pre><code>package { 'apache2':\n        provider=&gt;'apt',\n        ensure=&gt;'installed',\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is installed.':\n}\n \nservice { 'apache2':\n        ensure=&gt;'running',\n}\n \nnotify { 'Apache2 is running.':\n}\n \nPackage['apache2'] -&gt; Notify['Apache2 is running.'] -&gt; Service['apache2'] -&gt; Notify['Apache2 is installed.']\n</code></pre>\n<p>That’s it for metaparameters, on the next one there will be modules!</p>\n",

I will give you examples of every core resource type there is by default on Puppet.</p>\n<p>This post will include all the core resource types found on Puppet. Notify, file, package, service, exec, cron, user and group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usage\" tabindex=\"-1\">Usage <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You can use these by writing a file with the resource text and using <code>puppet apply FILENAME</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notify\" tabindex=\"-1\">Notify <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Notify sends a message to the clients and will be saved to Puppet logs. Example sends “Notification to the clients”-text to the logs.</p>\n<pre><code>notify { 'Notification to the clients':\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"file\" tabindex=\"-1\">File <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With File resource you can control everything about files. This example writes some data into /tmp/helloPuppet -file.</p>\n<pre><code>file { '/tmp/helloPuppet':\n        content =&gt; 'See you at Lennu.net!\\n'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"package\" tabindex=\"-1\">Package <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Package resource gives you management over installable packages. On the example I’m installing package via apt-get. Remember you have to use <code>sudo</code> to do installation of packages.</p>\n<pre><code>package { 'nethack-spoilers':\n        provider=&gt;'apt',\n        ensure=&gt;'installed'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"service\" tabindex=\"-1\">Service <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Service resource manages services running on the client for example Apache2. The following example checks that Apache2 is running, if it’s not it will be started.</p>\n<pre><code>service { 'apache2':\n        ensure=&gt;'running'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"exec\" tabindex=\"-1\">Exec <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Exec resource as it’s name says executes something. For example the following will <code>apt-get update</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>exec { 'apt-get update':\n        path=&gt;'/usr/bin/'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"cron\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cron <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Cron creates and controls cron jobs in the system. For example we can run <code>logrotate</code> every day at 05:00.</p>\n<pre><code>cron { logrotate:\n        command=&gt;'/usr/sbin/logrotate',\n        user=&gt;lennu,\n        hour=&gt;5,\n        minute=&gt;0\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"user\" tabindex=\"-1\">User <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With User resource we can control users and mostly system users. On the example we set users full name as comment to user lennu.</p>\n<pre><code>user { 'lennu':\n\tcomment=&gt;&quot;Juha-Matti Laaksonen&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"group\" tabindex=\"-1\">Group <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Group resource is made for managing groups and mostly creating them. Example ensures the lennu.net -group exists. If it doesn’t, it will be created.</p>\n<pre><code>group { 'lennu.net':\n\tensure=&gt;'present'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"documentation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Documentation <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-resource-examples/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>That’s for core resource types, you can find all the details and rest of the attributes used by Puppet from their <a href=\"http://docs.puppetlabs.com/\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this page useful! If you have any questions about the examples, please post a comment and we’ll see if I can help you out.</p>\n",

This is all tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and continues my Puppet series where I am going through all the necessary and important aspects of Linux’s Puppet software.</p>\n<h3 id=\"class\" tabindex=\"-1\">Class <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-module-and-class-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I will continue using the same example of Apache2 I have used during my last posts about Puppet.</p>\n<p>In order to make classes work we need to apply them a little bit differently than normal manifests. With <code>puppet apply --verbose apacheclassname.pp</code> you can use the class written below.</p>\n<pre><code>class apacheclassname {\n\tpackage { 'apache2':\n\t\tprovider=&gt;'apt',\n\t\tensure=&gt;'installed'\n\t}\n \n\tnotify { 'Apache2 is installed.':\n\t}\n \n\tservice { 'apache2':\n\t\tensure=&gt;'running'\n\t}\n \n\tnotify { 'Apache2 is running.':\n\t}\n}\n#Remember to declare the class below\nclass {'apacheclassname': }\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"module\" tabindex=\"-1\">Module <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-module-and-class-examples/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Modules are used by Puppet to autoload manifests, so you can use classes stored in a module from anywhere. Now we need to take our just created class into a module. Modules file and folder structure is at its simplest like this: <code>modules/modulename/manifests</code> in this folder you have init.pp which will be ran everytime you do something with the module.</p>\n<p>Place the code below to this init.pp file in modules/apache/manifests/ and run it with <code>puppet apply --modulepath PATHtoMODULeDIRECTORY -e &quot;include apacheclassname&quot;</code></p>\n<pre><code>class apacheclassname {\n        package { 'apache2':\n                provider=&gt;'apt',\n                ensure=&gt;'installed'\n        }\n \n        notify { 'Apache2 is installed.':\n        }\n \n        service { 'apache2':\n                ensure=&gt;'running'\n        }\n \n        notify { 'Apache2 is running.':\n        }\n}\n#Remember NOT to declare the class in here\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is another module about file permissions which changes the default www-directory to be used www-data user. This should go to <code>modules/wwwdir/init.pp</code> and you can run it with <code>puppet apply --modulepath PATHtoMODULeDIRECTORY -e &quot;include wwwdir&quot;</code></p>\n<pre><code>class wwwdir {\n        file{ '/var/www':\n\t\tensure=&gt;'directory',\n\t\towner=&gt;'www-data',\n\t\tgroup=&gt;'www-data',\n\t\tmode=&gt;'664',\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There was some example classes and modules. I hope they helped you out!</p>\n",

On todays post I will review one Puppet Forge module and see how many similar are there. On this post I will also show some examples based on the official Puppet Cookbook.</p>\n<h3 id=\"puppet-forge-camptocamp-apt\" tabindex=\"-1\">Puppet Forge camptocamp/apt <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-forge-and-cookbook/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://forge.puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet Forge</a> is a website where you can find modules already made by some contributors. I chose <a href=\"http://forge.puppetlabs.com/camptocamp/apt\">camptocamp/apt</a> as my example module. I tested this module on my Ubuntu 12.04.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-it-does\" tabindex=\"-1\">What it does? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-forge-and-cookbook/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>1. First of all it requires you to have apt in your system.<br>\n2. It updates your repositories.<br>\n3. It sets some config to apt, which includes periodic Update-Package-Lists=1, Download-Upgradeable-Package=0, AutoCleanInterval=1.<br>\n4. The most important: It sets a directory watch from its files to control /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.</p>\n<p>So with this module you can control apt sources with your Puppet on all the clients.</p>\n<h4 id=\"other-similar-modules\" tabindex=\"-1\">Other similar modules? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-forge-and-cookbook/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>There are Puppet Labs own <a href=\"http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt\">apt module</a> which is very wide and has all the most used apt modules available. One very similar to this is <a href=\"http://forge.puppetlabs.com/DavidSchmitt/apt\">David Schmitt’s apt module</a> which also controls sources list but also apt’s caches.</p>\n<h3 id=\"puppet-cookbook\" tabindex=\"-1\">Puppet Cookbook <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-forge-and-cookbook/\">#</a></h3>\n<h4 id=\"override-a-facter-fact\" tabindex=\"-1\">Override a Facter fact <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-forge-and-cookbook/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>I found interesting example of how to override one Facter’s facts and here is an example for it. The example shows a way to change uptime for the instance.</p>\n<pre><code>$ FACTER_uptime='5:00 hours' puppet -e 'notify {&quot;Our system have ran for: $uptime.&quot;: }'\nnotice: Our system have ran for: 0:53 hours hours.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>$ FACTER_uptime='5:00 hours' puppet -e 'notify {&quot;Our system have ran for: $uptime.&quot;: }'\nnotice: Our system have ran for: 5:00 hours.\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"managing-symlinks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Managing Symlinks <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/puppet-forge-and-cookbook/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Here is an example module for managing symlink for motd. The module makes sure you have the right setup for your motd symlink. You can run the module with <code>sudo puppet apply --modulepath puppet/modules/ -e &quot;include motd&quot;</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>.\n└── manifests\n    ├── init.pp\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>class motd {\n\tfile { '/etc/motd':\n\t\tensure =&gt; 'link',\n\t\ttarget =&gt; '/var/run/motd',\n\t\towner =&gt; 'root',\n\t\tgroup =&gt; 'root',\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

And whos’ is it?</p>\n<p>University offers a place for saving documents in public Internet, known as public_html within students personal data folder. When you save a file in there, the file will be in the Internet. I guess university should make some clarifications for some students that their files truly are publicly available when they save a file in their public folder.</p>\n<h3 id=\"experiment\" tabindex=\"-1\">Experiment <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/over-37000-student-files-crawled-from-a-finnish-university-website/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>After being online for quite some time, my friend released some statistics <a href=\"http://tradenomi.noob.fi/tophaut.php\">tradenomi.noob.fi/tophaut.php</a>. These are the top 20 searches done lately. I’ll translate some of them here: cv, programming, mathematics, pictures, businessprocesses and of course porn and sex.</p>\n<p>So there have been some proper searches and I guess some good results too.</p>\n<p>The site is elegantly build and serves its’ purpose nicely. It caused a lot of discussion in our university and as far as I know it has already been reported to the ICT-security team of the university. The best thing about this site is of course the fact that you can go and search for a file that contains your next deadline homework.</p>\n<p>Go check it out at <a href=\"http://tradenomi.noob.fi\">tradenomi.noob.fi</a>.</p>\n",

You have succesfully installed Octopress to your Ubuntu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rsync-deployement\" tabindex=\"-1\">Rsync deployement <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In order to publish your Octopress blog into your own webserver, you have to send the public files to the server. In this tutorial I assume you have setup the normal user account web publishing configurations.</p>\n<p>Here are the steps how to use Rsync to publish your website:</p>\n<h3 id=\"server-modifications\" tabindex=\"-1\">Server modifications <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We will start by creating an account to the server.</p>\n<p>Login to your server and use <code>sudo adduser</code> command to add the user.</p>\n<p>We also need to install rsync with the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt\\-get install rsync\n</code></pre>\n<p>After this you can logout from your server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setting-up-public-key-authorization-between-ubuntu-and-server\" tabindex=\"-1\">Setting up public key authorization between Ubuntu and Server <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>First we create a public key with the following commands.</p>\n<pre><code>ssh\\-keygen\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will be asked where to save the key. Save the key to the default directory by pressing Enter.</p>\n<pre><code>Generating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/lennu/.ssh/id\\_rsa):\nInsert a passphrase for two times and the key will be created.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Created directory '/home/lennu/.ssh'.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in /home/lennu/.ssh/id\\_rsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /home/lennu/.ssh/id\\_rsa.pub.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to send the public key to the server, specifically in your just created users’ home directory.<br>\nWe can use ssh to send the file to your server.</p>\n<pre><code>cat .ssh/id\\_rsa.pub | ssh username@server &quot;mkdir .ssh;cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized\\_keys&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"configuring-rsync\" tabindex=\"-1\">Configuring rsync <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Edit Rakefile in your octopress directory. Modify the following values.</p>\n<pre><code>ssh\\_user       \\= &quot;[\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)&quot;\ndocument\\_root  \\= &quot;~/public\\_html/&quot;\nrsync\\_delete   \\= true\ndeploy\\_default \\= &quot;rsync&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"publishing-the-website\" tabindex=\"-1\">Publishing the website <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the configurations are set, you can run the following commands and publish the website. Enter your Ubuntu password on prompt.</p>\n<pre><code>rake generate \\# Generates the static website files\nrake deploy \\# Uses rsync to send the files to the server\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should now get something like this at your public website.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/4DKd0svvHZ-640.avif 640w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/4DKd0svvHZ-640.webp 640w\"><img alt=\"Default installation of Octopress\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/4DKd0svvHZ-640.jpeg\" width=\"640\" height=\"493\"></picture></p>\n<h2 id=\"blogging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Blogging <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Now you are ready to start blogging with Octopress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Configurations <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Most important configurations can be found from the <code>_config.yml</code>. Just edit that and you can change all the default values like title and author to your own.</p>\n<p>After changes just type the following commands and the site will be published.</p>\n<pre><code>rake generate \\# Generates the static website files\nrake deploy \\# Uses rsync to send the files to the server\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"posting-with-octopress\" tabindex=\"-1\">Posting with Octopress <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Create a new blog post with the following command. You need to be in the octopress directory to do this.</p>\n<pre><code>rake new\\_post\\[&quot;Name of your post&quot;\\]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you may go and edit it in <code>source/_posts/</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Again after you have written your post and want to publish it to the website, use these commands.</p>\n<pre><code>rake generate \\# Generates the static website files\nrake deploy \\# Uses rsync to send the files to the server\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"preview-posts\" tabindex=\"-1\">Preview posts <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h4>\n<p>If you want to preview your posts before publishing, use only the <code>rake generate</code> and see the changes yourself with the command <code>rake preview</code> and head on to web browser and type in localhost:4000.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Documentation <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/octopress-installation/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The official Octopress <a href=\"http://www.octopress.org/docs/\">Documentation</a> is a good place to find more information about posting and using different kind of plugins and code blocks in your blog.</p>\n<p>If you need more information about Octopress, be sure to check it out for answers!</p>\n",

If you dig to the code you’ll find these statements:</p>\n<p><code>@media handheld and (max-width: 480px), screen and (max-device-width: 480px), screen and (max-width: 767px) { }</code><br>\nand<br>\n<code>@media handheld and (max-width: 479px), screen and (max-device-width: 479px), screen and (max-width: 479px) { }</code></p>\n<p>So what these basicly do are optimization for different handheld devices. And it works just by giving these statements in the CSS code and writing special code in them which will be used when the window size is in the required region.</p>\n<p>The magic is that these statements override the normal CSS settings when window size is small enough. So you them with that logic.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tablet-structure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tablet structure <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/html5-responsive-design-guide-and-skeleton/\">#</a></h4>\n<pre><code>@media handheld and (max-width: 480px), screen and (max-device-width: 480px), screen and (max-width: 767px)  {\n\tbody{\n\t\tpadding:0 20px;\n\t}\n\theader .main-nav {\n\t\tmargin-left:4%;\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>On this example code we give tablet version of the page some padding and give main-navigation margin. Which does the effect that page works better on tablets.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mobile-phone-structure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mobile Phone structure <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/html5-responsive-design-guide-and-skeleton/\">#</a></h4>\n<pre><code>@media handheld and (max-width: 479px), screen and (max-device-width: 479px), screen and (max-width: 479px)  {\n\tbody{\n\t\n\t}\n \n\theader #logo {\n\t\ttext-indent:-99999999px;\n\t\twidth:244px;\n\t\theight:75px;\n\t\tfloat:none;\n\t\tmargin:0 auto 40px; auto;\n\t}\n\theader #logo a {\n\t\tbackground:url(../images/logo.png) no-repeat;\n\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\twidth:244px;\n\t\theight:75px;\n\t}\n\theader {\n\t\tborder-bottom:none;\n\t}\n \n\theader .main-nav{\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t\tmargin-left:0;\n\t}\n\theader .main-nav ul {\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t}\n\theader .main-nav ul li, header .main-nav ul &gt; li.last{\n\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\tfloat:none;\n\t\ttext-align:center;\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t}\n\theader .main-nav ul li a{\n\t\tpadding:4px 0;\n\t\tbackground:#e4e4e4;\n\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\tmargin-bottom:4px;\n\t}\n\tdiv.columns{\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t}\n\tdiv.one{\n\t\tmargin-left:0;\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t}\n \n\theader #searchform {\n\t\tfloat:right;\n\t\tmargin-top:10px;\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t\tmargin-bottom:20px;\n\t} \n\theader #searchform #s {\n\t\tborder:1px solid #cecece;\n\t\twidth:16px;\n\t\t-webkit-border-radius:40px;\n\t\t-moz-border-radius:40px;\n\t\t-o-border-radius:40px;\n\t\tborder-radius:40px;\n\t\tpadding:10px;\n\t\tbackground:#e2e2e2 url(../images/magnify.png) no-repeat  50% 50%;\n\t\t-webkit-transition-duration: 400ms; \n    -webkit-transition-property: width, background; \n    -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease; \n    -moz-transition-duration: 400ms; \n    -moz-transition-property: width, background;\t\n    -moz-transition-timing-function: ease; \n    -o-transition-duration: 400ms; \n    -o-transition-property: width, background; \n    -o-transition-timing-function: ease;\n\t\tcursor:pointer;\n\t\tcolor:#4b4b4b;\n\t\ttext-indent:-999999px;\n\t}\n\theader #searchform #s:focus {\n\t\toutline:none;\n\t\tbackground:#e2e2e2 url(../images/magnify.png) no-repeat 4% 50%;\n\t\tpadding-left:34px;\n\t\twidth:90%;\n\t\ttext-indent:0px;\n\t\t\n\t}\n \n\t.copyright, .footer-nav{\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t\tfloat:none;\n\t}\n\t.copyright,\t.footer-nav {\n\t\ttext-align:center;\n\t}\n \n\t#main-content .text-intro h2 {\n\t\tfont-size:30px;\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>On this example we do alot of stuff to the optimization for the mobile phone.

The first two years was mainly learning to read and write properly and we also had mathematics to teach us the multiplication table. I also took part in some speech courses where I learned to pronounce letter R the right way, it was some kind of bonus course but really worth the time. These first two years formed mostly from four hours per day of education and there were a lot of sports also involved in the experience.</p>\n<p>After the first two years, areas of nature sciences and foreign languages were added into the picture. The 10 year old citizens also were taught about handwork which included workshops with items made of wood. This is where the first choices had to be made about the education areas. Each student (parents) could choose from woodwork or sewing, you also had to choose if you wanted to learn Swedish or English as a second language, I went for English.</p>\n<p>The last four years of Primary Education went fast because in those years we saw a computer for the first time in the education process, this was about the year of 2000. We rushed to play RuneScape which was a hugely popular game at the time. Computers came into the picture and some even had own computers at their homes. Everyday we went to someone and played RuneScape for a long time.</p>\n<p>I started in school at the age of six and I had been in school for six years. Mother tongue and mathematics were generally the most important areas in Primary Education and they prepared us for the Lower Secondary Education very well. So I had learned these areas well. Of course we had biology, geography, arts, history and all these things but they weren’t nearly as important as it was to teach us how to multiply correctly. I was 12 years old and I knew how to read and write finnish, speak, read and write some english and multiply correctly. All the other things that were not so important had located in brain into the area of common knowledge. I was playing football a lot at the time and I was pretty good at it because I had been training for six years, but as we know government doesn’t really care about that. So I was going to step on the next step and I was ready to conquer to world!</p>\n<h3 id=\"lower-secondary-education\" tabindex=\"-1\">Lower Secondary Education <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/finnish-education-system/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>And we started to learn mother tongue, mathematics and foreign languages. Of course the difficulty rose a lot but we still mainly focused for the last years of Comprehensive School to these elements.</p>\n<p>At this stage of life when you are about 12-15 year old, you start to realize that there are something else out there than just school and you go through a huge mental growth. I wasn’t really interested or focused to the mission of education at the time because I thought it was boring and stupid. I played a lot of video games and tried out new things, none of these mattered to the Education System, they still wanted us to learn about the subjects we had studied over half of our lives. These are important topics but they just didn’t interest me at the time. Well I learned them somehow anyway.</p>\n<p>Lower Secondary Education lasts for three years and you need to succeed on everything in order to graduate from Primary Education, if you don’t, you have a chance to be facing a another year in the Lower Secondary Education and that was a huge motivation for everyone. At this point Finnish Education System pushes the students to learn everything and well because of this and for another reason. The next study place you get is solely chosen by the results of your studies, if you are bad enough the government might think that the education for you is over.</p>\n<p>So the main three areas were still the most important and we all learned them very well. We also had mandatory classes about the language of Sweden and general subjects such as biology, history or chemistry.</p>\n<p>Lower Secondary Education ended about at the age of 15. This is the last mandary step the government required you to do. If you don’t want to continue, you don’t have to. Most of us of course continued to Upper Secondary General School or Upper Secondary Vocational School, I went for both. Suddenly there is a huge decision to be made after nine years of Primary School, how to continue your education and where to focus? You could choose a more professionally developed path or continue with the general subjects.</p>\n<p>At this point I had learned a lot how the world works but I really didn’t know at all why I knew these things and why I had been studying them. Because I had always liked computers and spend a lot of time with them, I went for double degree to study general subjects and computer science.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upper-secondary-general-vocational-school\" tabindex=\"-1\">Upper secondary general/vocational school <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/finnish-education-system/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I applied to this school and went even through psychological tests to qualify. This was a huge game changer and changed everything for me in terms of education. The first day of this school started in a computer classroom. I was sold at the very moment.</p>\n<p>I started to really focus on school and got great results on the subjects that I had interest in. I met with a lot of same minded people and collaborated with them to projects and studies.</p>\n<p>For three years we studied programming with Java, relational databases with SQL, websites and computer science in general. They interested me so much that I bought this domain and started to do something in the internet. You can check archive.org of this site if you are interested.</p>\n<p>As I had chosen double degree, I had some general topics also about math, mother tongue and english. This was a good option for me since they were not the main subjects anymore, but they were the extra studies, that somehow got me interested more about them.</p>\n<p>So finally the education system had found my interest in life and where I could make myself a living one day. I managed to do the double degree in three years which was kind of achievement considering that the path is made for four and a half years. The last episode was training where I did websites for six months and the final matriculation examination of the other side of the double degree. Everything went fine.</p>\n<p>At this point it was 2009 and I was 18 years old. For many who hasn’t done double degree, this is the hardest part, because this is the last stage where you can decide what you are going to do for the rest of your life, or at least some time. It was the time to apply for universities. As I had made my choice of career three years ago, I decided to apply to University of Applied Sciences. Thats the more professionally valued university option in the education of Finland.</p>\n<h2 id=\"university\" tabindex=\"-1\">University <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/finnish-education-system/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I got right in on the application process which were due to my good success in computer sciences and the fact that I had a double degree. I was on computer science study path and I suddendly realized that the stuff they are teaching is the same stuff I had learned over the last three years. So, the subjects were very familiar for me and I got great grades of all the computer science related classes. We also had mathematics, mother tongue and foreign languages, as we had had over the last twelve years. Well it didn’t matter so much as I had my interest in other areas, and these subjects carried on with me.</p>\n<p>I chose the innovation path as a deepening subject and found out great new things how to do programming and how to make robots and such things. I went active on the student union and had quite great times with them, but I always had in mind that I’m here to learn.</p>\n<p>The years went on and I gathered as much information as I could, but at the end I think the hardest things I had to do were as hard as the things I had done already on my double degree. So there were no challenge as I had hoped. I had good papers graduating, and I though now is the time to use my skills.</p>\n<p>After the university I went right into army and did my six months of service for the country. I applied for jobs and got to pretty good one where I code daily, doing websites with HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finnish-education-system\" tabindex=\"-1\">Finnish Education System <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/finnish-education-system/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So after the university, I had studied for sixteen years in Finland and I was 22 years old. Remember? I was six years old when I started. I could have applied for masters degree if I wanted but I had had enough.</p>\n<p>As a conclusion I could say it was a great ride and the last seven years were the best. The Education system of Finland was done for me. It gave me a career, friends, love and most importantly: a future.</p>\n<p>I’m working now full time and may return some day to do the masters degree, who knows. At this point Finland has taught me how to read, write, foreign languages, mathematics and other general subjects. And most importantly I have learned how to use the skills by creating something amazing with computer sciences. That was the catch I think of all the learning of those general subjects.</p>\n<p>How I would rate the education in Finland? 5/5</p>\n",

Anyway there are alot of things in that tutorial that are not explained and you just need to know.</p>\n<p>So here is a full step by step tutorial for deploying Django 1.6 web framework. I have tested this tutorial with Ubuntu 12.04.</p>\n<p>Requirements for this tutorial</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux knowledge</li>\n<li>Fresh Ubuntu 12.04 installation on a server</li>\n<li>Root access to that server</li>\n<li>Domain</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"environment\" tabindex=\"-1\">Environment <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/django-deployment-installation-to-ubuntu-12-dot-04-server/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In this tutorial the user we are using is <code>root</code> and we will install Django in /srv/ folder. Of course you may use another user and sudo everything, and install in some other directory, but this tutorial does not scale to that. This Django installation is safe and secure and we are going to create a new system user to run mod_WSGI with Apache. Python will be handled by VirtualEnv.</p>\n<h2 id=\"django-1-6-deployment-on-ubuntu-12-04\" tabindex=\"-1\">Django 1.6 deployment on Ubuntu 12.04 <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/django-deployment-installation-to-ubuntu-12-dot-04-server/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So we start of with updating the system.</p>\n<pre><code>apt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"hostname\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hostname <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/django-deployment-installation-to-ubuntu-12-dot-04-server/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Choose here name for your server.

Application development to Android can be made in two different ways. The first and the most used way of these two is to produce applications with native development style, where the application’s source code is written in operating system’s default programming languages and style. The second approach is to use application development framework, where the application’s source code is written by the rules and programming languages needed for the application development framework.</p>\n<p>At the moment every popular mobile operating system uses different native development style, and if a developer wants to develop an applications for several different mobile operating system, he or she has to make the programming for each and every different mobile operating system he or she wishes the developed application would work on. PhoneGap which is made and marketed by Adobe is the most popular application development framework, and it is run by open source project Apache Cordova in its core, which gives developers different kind of approach to mobile application development. The reasons behind PhoneGap have been to bring programming style and languages of web development to the toolkit of every popular mobile operating system, and with this make it possible to use these same techniques on mobile application development across all these popular mobile operating systems. PhoneGap gives developers a chance to work on one source code and copy that to all mobile operating systems supported by the application development framework.</p>\n<p>When developing to Android, the basic structure of source code’s directories is always the same, and even if application development frameworks were used, there are certain Android specific configuration files that are always necessary to be included in the source code. If there is application development framework used in the development, there has to be some referral in these configuration files which makes it possible to use these application development frameworks.</p>\n<p>When developing to Android on native way the main programming language is Java and when programming the applications there are usually used some of the Android’s own Java libraries. With the help of the libraries developer can make a connection to the properties of the device which runs the operating system, but otherwise programming usually follows the basic structures of Java. Google has made a guide on the development of Android native applications, where it suggests to use so called activities when programming applications and follow the style of the guide when doing the applcation development. Native applications can still be made in a way the developer wants and that is the strength of native application development, because every way is possible. There is even chance to write under the native defined programming layer, when there is chance to use C-based languages to improve the performance of the applications.</p>\n<p>If PhoneGap is used, the application development framework has to be installed in the basic structure of Android application’s source code, and it has to be referred in the configuration files which will get it started at the beginning of the application’s start process. On the installation process of PhoneGap there will be made an own development folder, where the developer writes the source code of the application and from where the application is in the end ran. The programming languages used in PhoneGap are standardized in the web development field, which includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Usually Android applications made with PhoneGap use HTML and CSS to create the base and user interface for the application and the behaviour and interactivity with JavaScript. This is the basic structure of development with PhoneGap and it cannot be escaped, and shouldn’t have to, and it is the biggest difference between native development and PhoneGap. With PhoneGap there is a JavaScript library which enables the use of properties in the device which is running the mobile operating system, so that you can bring for example GPS-data from the device to your application. Native source code can be executed on the side of PhoneGap but it is not very supported since it breaks the base idea behind PhoneGap which is to make it possible to run the source code on different platforms. After applying PhoneGap to development process the development methods can be used exactly the same way as making a website but for the sake of interactivity with the user it is recommended to use JavaScript to give the application some actions and interactivity.</p>\n<p>There are some great differences between PhoneGap and native development and they both have a place in the development of applications for Android operating system. Native development is recommended to use in applications in favor for better user experience and for greater performance. PhoneGap mobile application framework gives the opportunity for simple approach to producing mobile applications with programming languages easy and well-known and the compatability with the most used mobile operating systems with once written source code. Native mobile applications can be described as more advanced because they are usually used to produce more difficult applications like Angry Birds, but native way has decreased in popularity after the launch of application development frameworks like PhoneGap. PhoneGap and other application development frameworks are developing all the time and with fast pace, and at the moment they win native development easily in the ease and speed of development.</p>\n<p>More information about PhoneGap and getting started guide can be found at their website: <a href=\"http://www.phonegap.com/\">www.phonegap.com</a>.</p>\n",

The program can be used in Linux or Windows as long as there is Python installed into the system.</p>\n<p>Here are some screenshots with the same examples as used in the earlier handwritten DES encryption.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/o3LaTsIXpO-360.avif 360w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/o3LaTsIXpO-360.webp 360w\"><img alt=\"Key and Message\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/o3LaTsIXpO-360.png\" width=\"360\" height=\"156\"></picture></p>\n<p>After clicking the encrypt button.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/3iNENlYjMb-360.avif 360w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/3iNENlYjMb-360.webp 360w\"><img alt=\"Cipher\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/3iNENlYjMb-360.png\" width=\"360\" height=\"156\"></picture></p>\n<p>After clicking the decrypt button</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/gXBQSfOa8n-360.avif 360w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/gXBQSfOa8n-360.webp 360w\"><img alt=\"Decrypted\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.lennu.net/img/gXBQSfOa8n-360.png\" width=\"360\" height=\"156\"></picture></p>\n<h3 id=\"usage\" tabindex=\"-1\">Usage <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/data-encryption-standard-made-with-key-sizes-of-14-bits/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This was just an experiment if I could learn DES and some cryptography, this software should not be used in real life situations. The method I used actually made DES weaker against attacks because I did it with less bits than the usual version. I hope maybe someone may find this information useful and maybe learn some cryptography. In my opinion it’s a really complex world and so much different from traditional software development, because of the mathematics that are included.</p>\n<h3 id=\"source-code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Source Code <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.lennu.net/2015/data-encryption-standard-made-with-key-sizes-of-14-bits/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here is the source code for this software.

It also makes a few directories for torrents and at the end sets <code>.torrent</code> files to a folder which the daemon is looking.</p>\n<p>Here is more explained list in order what the module does on the client.</p>\n<p>1. Installs <code>transmission-daemon</code> from package manager<br>\n2. Creates folder <code>/srv/torrents</code><br>\n3. Creates folder <code>/srv/torrents/torrent-files</code><br>\n4. Creates folder <code>/srv/torrents/torrent-data</code><br>\n5. Stops <code>transmission-daemon</code> service (because transmission-daemon overwrites its configuration when stopped so we cannot apply changes to the configuration while the service is running)<br>\n6. Replaces <code>/etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json</code> with Modules own <code>settings.json</code><br>\n7. Starts <code>transmission-daemon</code> service with exec (this is the only way to change config of service which need to be stopped before changes, since Puppet can set service only to one state)<br>\n8. Adds <code>.torrent</code> files from Modules files to <code>/srv/torrents/torrent-files/</code> directory<br>\n9. <code>transmission-daemon</code> automaticly adds files from <code>/srv/torrent/torrent-files/</code> directory and starts downloading them</p>\n<p>Notices made by Puppet</p>\n<pre><code>$ sudo puppet apply --modulepath puppet/modules/ -e &quot;include
